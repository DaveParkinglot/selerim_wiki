- Civil war fought 25 years ago between the 4 big families of Tiialia:
	- [[The Adonzio Family]] (current rulers)
	- [[The Fanto-Domingo Family]]
	- [[The Landucci Family]]
		- [[Francis Greenstrider De Luca]]'s father died fighting on the side of the Landuccis during the war
		- Francis' family (the DeLucas) are a minor house of Tiialia, following the Landuccis
	- [[The Esposito Family]]
-  The Tiialan royal line died out 75 years prior to the War of the Four Families, during the decade long Serpent War with the yuan-ti
	- The last king of Tiialia, King Seraphino, was killed during the First Siege of [[Corrodreth, The Salted City]]
	- A year after the First Siege, Tiialia rallied for the Second Siege of Corrodreth. The city was pillaged, destroyed, and finally salted to avenge King Seraphino, the Last King of Tiialia
- Prior to the War of the Four Families, Tiialia had been without a king for 75 years, ruled by a single Regent Lord: Aleemus the Aged. His death opened a power vacuum, which the Four Families began to fight for.
- Originally it was a free for all between the families, but this changed when the Adonzios and the Landuccis formed an alliance after the Midsummer Massacre, when the [[The Fanto-Domingo Family]]  wiped out [[The Esposito Family]]
