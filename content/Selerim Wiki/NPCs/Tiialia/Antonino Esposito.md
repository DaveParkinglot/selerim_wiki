### Overview
- Last known remnant of the blood of the Old Kings of Tiialia.
- Sole survivor of the Midsummer Massacre, last remaining member of the once powerful [[The Esposito Family]].
- He was great friends with [[Francis Greenstrider De Luca]]â€™s father Marco, before his death at the hands of [[The Fanto-Domingo Family]].
- He worked as a spy with Marco De Luca when they were younger
	- "Nino" was the fourth son of the Esposito family, and never had a thought of becoming a leader within the family
	- He is last member of his family, and he has the Fanto-Domingos to thank for everything
[[00 -The High Rollers Campaign-]]
- He still held some sway, and had been working as a Tiialan spymaster out of his family's vineyard, supporting [[The Landucci Family]] and [[The Adonzio Family]].
- Despite this, [[Lord Draco Landucci]] schemed to send him to the countryside, giving ownership of his vineyard to [[Trilbee Rampo]].
- [[The High Rollers]], adventuring in the Forsaken Expanse, intercepted Trilbee and forced him to cede ownership of his new vineyard to them.
- Working together with [[The High Rollers]], Nino discovered his true ancestry, overthrew the tyrant lord Landucci, and rightfully took the crown of Tiialia for himself.
