### Overview
An old timey butler from Nova Jersaeria.

- His family has served the [[Selerim Wiki/Locations/The Kingdom of Tiialia/The Families of Tiialia/The Esposito Family]] for generations. An age-old bargain between the Espositos and the Dentes states that the Espositos pay for passage aboard [[Selerim Wiki/Locations/Ghoulfen Island/The Necronaut of Mournholde]] when a Dente who has loyally served them reaches the age of 75.
- This bargain was struck between Albert's great great great great grandfather, Albert, and the progenitor of the Esposito family, Quintino
- This practice has withstood the test of time, and there are now several generations of Dentes living in [[Selerim Wiki/Locations/Ghoulfen Island/Mournholde]].
- He has a daughter named Allie (short for Alberta) who lives in the countryside working as a cleric of the god Selune.
- She plans to take his place after he soon embarks on the [[Selerim Wiki/Locations/Ghoulfen Island/The Necronaut of Mournholde]].
