### Overview
- An old timey butler from Nova Jersaeria.
- His family has served the [[The Esposito Family]] for generations. An age-old bargain between the [[The Esposito Family]] and the Dentes states that the Espositos pay for passage aboard [[The Necronaut of Mournholde]] when a Dente who has loyally served them reaches the age of 75.
- This bargain was struck between Albert's great great great great grandfather, Albert, and the progenitor of the Esposito family, Quintino
- This practice has withstood the test of time, and there are now several generations of Dentes living in [[Mournholde]].
- He has a daughter named Allie (short for Alberta) who lives in the countryside working as a cleric of the god Selune.
- She plans to take his place after he soon embarks on the [[The Necronaut of Mournholde]].
