### Overview
- Thief, spymaster, father figure to the hapless Hoary Boulder.
- After his initial heist of [[Beezlebop]]'s woodland manor led to the deaths of most of his crew, Sleeto put together a new crew with [[Hoary Boulder]] and [[The High Rollers]] to heist the mansion. This time it went much better, and for a while he became [[The High Rollers]]' eyes and ears in Crabbley.
