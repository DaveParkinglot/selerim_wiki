## Adventure Premise
- In the last year, [[Antonino Esposito|King Antonino Esposito]] of Tiialia has put massive funding towards reopening [[Selerim Wiki/Locations/The White Grove]] as an independent magical institution. For the first time in over two centuries, admission is available to anyone with magical abilities—not just those training to become Tiialan artillery mages. 
- [[Arctur Execlostrabaum]], the highly eccentric Tiialan archmage, has been chosen as the headmaster of the school. It goes without saying that his highly progressive mindset has been a topic of discussion amongst conservative Tiialans. He believes magic is a staple of the world, to be shared with all peoples whether north, south, above, or even below...
- We begin our adventure a few weeks into the first semester of your freshman year at The White Grove.
- You are in the midst of preparing for your first Intro to Infernal exam, a class taught by the Grove's newest professor—[[Professor Daemon Darkfyre|Daemon Darkfyre]].
## Outcomes
- After surviving a sabotaged magical staircase that flung them into multiple dimensions, the students began a legendary cram session to prepare for their Intro to Infernal Exam. 
- During this cram session, they collaborated with their fellow students to improve their chances at passing the exam. Some students became fast friends, while others became bitter enemies.
- Deep into their all-nighter, the students were interrupted by cultists from [[Morganth's Legion of Doom]], led by the senior [[Temur Octagon]]. They were searching the library for information about [[Tzastis the Collector]].
- The heroic students dispatched several Morganth cultists, and showed much restraint when delivering a non-lethal knockout blow to the traitorous Temur.
- The students passed the exam, except for Tony Gorgonzoli. He failed big time and will need to take Remedial Infernal.
- Headmaster [[Arctur Execlostrabaum]] congratulated the students and handed out rewards to them, though he was unwilling to alter Tony's grade due to his academic honesty policy.
