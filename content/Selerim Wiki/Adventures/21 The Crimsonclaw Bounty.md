## Adventure Premise
- For a sleepy fishing village, Crabbley has always had more than its fair share of threats from both the land and the sea.
- The latest monster to terrorize the town is a manticore the locals call "Old Crimsonclaw".
- After a string of gruesome attacks on townsfolk and livestock alike, Mayor Bastifor has posted a 450 gold bounty on Old Crimsonclaw's head.
- Your adventure begins at the Crab Claw Inn, a venue well known for cold brews and surf and turf specials.
- Whoever your character is, whether brave or foolish, they will soon leave the safety of the town to track Old Crimsonclaw through the twisting trails of the Tanglewood wilds...

## Outcomes
- The party retrieved the bounty and a map from [[Bopus]] after some carousing at the Crab Claw Inn.
- After leaving town, they ventured through the Tanglewood Wilds until they reached the old Greenspring Trail.
- While traveling the trail, they looted a dead member of the Crillville Defense Force and barely escaped an ambush by crocodiles, thanks to a friendly mud mephit named Jiggy Mudpie.
- Unbelievably, the manticore Old Crimsonclaw's nest was made atop the Leaky Bucket, the lost sailing ship of the famous privateer [[Captain Winchester Bone]].
- After handedly dispatching the manticore, the party was able to loot both the ship and the beast, finding many magical items and a disturbing note from the mutated manticore's creator, "The Gray Mage of Tanglewood".
