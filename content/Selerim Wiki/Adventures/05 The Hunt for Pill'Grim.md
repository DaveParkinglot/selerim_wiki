## Adventure Premise
- Many automatons created by the renowned inventor [[Dillon Lonergan]] malfunctioned under mysterious circumstances last week, wreaking havoc across all of [[Crabbley]].
- The notice boards around the town mention a large bounty on the head of the dastardly villain “[[Pill’Grim]]”, who is believed to be the perpetrator of this terrible crime.
- Meet [[Bopus]] at the Crab Claw Inn for more information.
- Should you succeed in Bopus’ quest, the bounty and the local fame would surely turn your life around.

## Outcomes
- Interdimensional hijinks and multiple fights with strange gnomish devices eventually led the party to a sanctuary farm world that Pill’Grim had peacefully settled in. Despite his years of tactical training and his gravy grenades, they were able to roast him in the end.
