- A blood hunter hailing from [[Selerim Wiki/Locations/Forsyth Keep]]

Tadeusz post chapter 3 downtime
- He got an urgent message from Balfur McHannock, leader of the Spellblade School of Bloodhunters asking him to urgently come and help him defeat a griffin that has been terrorizing Whitewater Hold, a keep in the mountains near the Bloodhunter Castle (who's name i forgot).
- The griffin's claw can be attached to a sword to strengthen the power of the sword, as well as provide a dash ability usable once a day. So slaying the beast serves two purposes, rescuing a town in distress and providing valuable research and equipment to the Bloodhunters.... if he can slay it
