- Blood Hunter ritual involves scaling the Sanguine Peak and defeating a series of challenges, including the corporeal spirits of legendary blood hunters

Peter's comments:
Forsyth Keep is located in the deep western Mountains, over the Great Delphin Sea. Treacherous, if youre inexperienced, to cross, it is filled with various sea monsters. The mountains of Velyn are very tall and equally as treacherous as the seas, but contain lush green valleys in which the Bloodhunters of Forsyth Keep train their abilities. Hiking down from the tall, cold, peaks proves easily... after braving and mapping the peaks yourself. You may need some extreme cold gear to venture up to the peaks, along with a fair bit of luck. Once you have found your way up, it should be easy to get back. The bloodhunters don't take kindly to outsiders, maybe you can prove that you're worth speaking to, somehow?
    
    When is a good question, whenever it fits in to the storyline I suppose. Go to New Jerseria, help the legion defeat a monstrous beast, which requires us to take a detour to visit Forsyth Keep to learn how to fight it?

- Proklor the Despoiler begins ravaging the Tiialan countryside, and the party must seek the help of the Blood Hunters to find ancient lore to help them defeat Proklor
