## Adventure Premise
- Your brilliant leader, the wicked sorcerer MORGANTH, seeks the eldritch powers of a powerful Yuan-Ti warlock who perished in the fall of CORRODRETH, THE SALTED CITY. As a devoted member of MORGANTH'S LEGION OF DOOM, you will aid your master even unto death. As such, you have agreed to infiltrate the accursed city and locate the warlock's tomb.

## Outcomes
- After days of travel through harsh deserts and desecrated grounds, the DÜM LEGION located the Tomb of Zalaash in the accursed city of Corrodreth. They deftly maneuvered their way through the trapped tomb and avoided any harsh consequences, until they were forced to maim one of their own to progress. 
- In an act of uncharacteristic selflessness, Doom Lord Bombus Mitz volunteered to have his legs sawed clean off. This granted access to the hidden treasures of Zalaash's sarcophagus, which contained a scale of the serpent god Dendar and a Blackfyre Orb, a profane implement of the lower planes. What could Lord Morganth wish to do with these two vile artifacts? Only time will tell…
