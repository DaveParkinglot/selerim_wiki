# Adventure Premise
- It has been 39 years to the day that Captain Winchester Bone was forced to turn on his first crew and his old first mate, [[Sharky Dolphino]]. Stricken with guilt, [[NPCs/Breakwater Cove/Captain Winchester Bone\|Bone]] tells his tale under the full moon on one foggy night...

# Outcomes
- Bone's hired crew never made it out of port, and Sharky Dolphino is still at large...
- This has probably made Captain Bone more paranoid about his former first mate returning to settle things.
