# Adventure Premise
- Over summer break, Headmaster [[NPCs/The White Grove/Arctur Execlostrabaum]] has challenged the students of [[Places/The White Grove]] to a competitive off-campus scavenger hunt.
- Students who succeed in the scavenger hunt will be given extra commendations in their culminating portfolio, which makes this an exceedingly valuable extra-curricular (if you care about having a successful career as a spellcaster).

# Outcomes

## Session 1
- [[Tony Gorgonzoli]] finally passed his Intro to Infernal exam, and the Study Group discussed their extracurriculars before embarking on the Headmaster's extra credit scavenger hunt.
- The first item in the scavenger hunt was recovered from cliffs, but not before a harpy almost drowned the party with its enchanting song.
- [[Crimslaw Brutefang]] had a realization: extra credit is far more important to him than assisting friends who are drowning.
- [[The Earl's]] father, [[The Duke]], came out of an empty weathered flask and congratulated the group on figuring out and locating the first clue: White Grove White Rum, brewed by the Headmaster for his class Advanced Magical Brewing.
- The group set out to locate the next clue, and while traveling through the wilderness they were assailed by an angry treachery of ravens.

## Session 2
- After pinpointing the location of the next item, the Study Group was set upon by flying snakes at an ancient Corrodrethian temple, and [[NPCs/The White Grove/Cristos Babblestaff]] proved himself extremely unhelpful in dealing with snakes.
- Provost Serpentios welcomed the group into the temple, where the second item was awaiting them. Unfortunately, he was a yuan-ti in disguise, and he turned hostile after trapping the students in the temple.
- After a short fight, the Provost was victorious and the unfortunate members of the Study Group were all knocked unconscious.

## Session 3
- [[NPCs/The White Grove/Cristos Babblestaff]] wandered back into the temple in the nick of time and was able to use his Aid spell scroll to save the day.
- Provost Serpentios was killed as he begged the students to spare him, saying that they could join him as members of [[Factions/Morganth's Legion of Doom]].
- Deeper in the temple, [[Sari]] was being held captive by the Provost, and the students were able to both rescue her and kill a large gelatinous cube filled with magic items.
- As Sari was already on her way to completing the scavenger hunt, she quickly joined with the party, and everyone grabbed a coconut, the second item in the scavenger hunt.
- After making their way back to [[Places/The White Grove]] campus, the students researched the meaning of the next clue of the scavenger hunt and took some much needed rest and relaxation.
- Despite the death (murder) of the Provost, and the discovery that he was in fact both a disguised yuan-ti AND an agent of [[Morganth]], no one, including [[NPCs/The White Grove/Cristos Babblestaff]], informed any of the faculty members of the school.

## Session 4
- The Study Group researched lore and maps regarding The White Grove's [[Primal Tree]] and the surrounding Primal Marshlands to improve their chances of finding the final scavenger hunt item.
- After concluding their study session, the students did some social shopping on The Quad, meeting both [[NPCs/The White Grove/Aurleth Writhesley]] and [[Pedro Sancho]].
- While on The Quad, they also saw that [[NPCs/The White Grove/Temur Octagon]] was being held in a prison portrait for his past crimes against the school. He claimed he was innocent and that he had been framed, but his pleas fell on deaf ears as [[NPCs/The White Grove/Professor Daemon Darkfyre]] dragged him back to be hung on the wall.
- The Study Group traversed the Primal Marshlands quite successfully, even receiving help from a giant ape named Bartumbus Vinecranker. 
- After Bartumbus left the students to their travels, they killed two sons of [[Scorpaxton]], the giant scorpion mascot of the [[Primal School]]. 
- Finally reaching the branches of the withered Primal Tree, the students made friends with yet another giant ape named Dirt Mud, by tending to his razorvine wounds with their healing spells and potions.
- Dirt Mud helped them reach the final scavenger hunt item: a crate of pineapples with a recipe for [[NPCs/The White Grove/Arctur Execlostrabaum]]'s Excellent Rum Bomb, along with a record of extra credit from the Headmaster himself.
- After such a successful outing, the party kicked back with their peers and [[NPCs/The White Grove/Professor Daemon Darkfyre]] at Leviathan Lagoon, enjoying the best thing summer vacation can offer: a sunny beach, trauma-bonded friends, and a great deal of rum.
