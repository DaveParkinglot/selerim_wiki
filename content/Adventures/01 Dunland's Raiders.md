## Details
- **DM**: Mike Doom
- **Platform:** Roll20
- **Sessions:** 2

## Adventure Premise
- You are members of the Tiialan army serving in a special cohort called Dunlands Raiders under [[NPCs/Tiialia/Captain Crebain Dunland]]. Your homelands are under attack by the forces of an evil warlock named [[Morganth]].
- The fate of all [[Factions/The Kingdom of Tiialia/Tiialia]] may well rest in your hands. Fight for honor! Fight for glory! Fight for your homelands and send these devils back to the nine hells!

## Outcomes
- Morganth's forces were pushed back into a small hold, where they used a relic called the [[Blackfyre Orb]] to summon a demon from the Infinite Abyss. 
- Dunland's Raiders defeated the demon, and eventually engaged in pitched combat against the remaining forces of Morganth in a barren field, where they were victorious.
- Skeeter Lutz went on a killing spree within the hold, killing many civilians.
- Eclipse Malificent was working for unknown forces, and turned on the party. He stole the Blackfyre Orb, using it to teleport to some abyssal plane.
