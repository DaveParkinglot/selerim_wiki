# Adventure Premise
- As every good elf in [[Places/Mitlin]] knows, on Giftmas Eve, the Archfey [[Krampus]] leads the Winter Hunt across the domains of the Feywild and into the myriad material planes, capturing those who have broken sacred pacts and stowing them in his big black punishment sack. This year, an innocent soul from your world was unjustly marked as a pactbreaker and claimed by The Hunt.
- The Wise Wizards of Mitlin have scried that this individual must be rescued, as they have information that could save the world. With no family to spend Giftmas with, you have been chosen for this perilous quest into the Feywild. [[NPCs/Tanglewood Peninsula/Melvin Oaksleeves\|Wise Wizard Melvin]]’s parting words echo in your mind: “This [[Selerim Worldbuilding/Holidays/Giftmas]], the fate of Selerim teeters on a knife's edge. One misstep, and all will careen into oblivion… so do try not to mess it up. Good luck!”

# Outcomes
- The [[Prince of Lamps and Luminosity]] aided the party by teleporting them to Winter in The Feywild, where they assisted Grammy Toothache in fending off Krampus' henchmen. They then navigated the terrors of Krampus' domain, The Yuleshade, and entered Krampus' hunting lodge under the premise of caroling. They bested Krampus' champion Jake Frost, and successfully petitioned Krampus for the release of the innocent soul they had sought to save.
- The individual held in Krampus' punishment sack was the troll [[NPCs/Other/Pudding]], who had crucial information about the disappearance of Selerim's foremost adventuring party, [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/The High Rollers]]. The party returned to Mitlin with Pudding, whose crucial information will undoubtedly influence future events—events known only to the Wise Wizards. Their arduous Giftmas quest completed, Mitlin's newest misfit heroes sat down for a mug of cocoa at Longwood Tavern.
