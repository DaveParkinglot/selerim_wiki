## Adventure Premise
- As an up and coming adventuring party in [[Scrimshaw City]], you have been approached by a mysterious stranger named [[Loeb]] who claims to be the Interim Chief Operating Officer of a well known business in the city. He has a task that, left undone, could spell doom for the local Tiialan eatery “[[The Spicy Meatball]]”.

## Outcomes
- After navigating through the Scrimshaw Wilds and the devious cave hideout of the redcap Fumbo Bimpis, the party was overwhelmed by tricksy fey and a diabolical Giant Goose. Rather than face imprisonment by the fey, the last conscious adventurer in the party pulled the pin on a Gnome-Nade, killing everyone (and the Giant Goose) instantly.
- Before their untimely demise, the party saw several objects stolen from The Spicy Meatball. Fumbo Bimpis appeared to be creating a mirror of The Spicy Meatball in the Feywild, including petrified humanoid bar patrons.
