## Adventure Premise
- Upstart duergar rebels led by one-time Inquisitor Initiate Dyksin Poosie have spoken out against [[High Lord Kranicz]]'s "rampant disregard of duergar culture".
- Dyksin and his fellow traitors are holed up at The Forge of Dingon, and initial reports indicate that their position is lightly fortified.
- They must be dealt with swiftly before they rally more disgruntled, disloyal duergar to their side.

## Outcomes
- Despite its significance as a duergar heritage site, The Forge of Dingon was host to a bloodbath as Inquisitors clashed with the traitorous duergar rebels, killing them all.
- The victorious Inquisitors found and explored a newly dug tunnel leading to the surface, seemingly dug as an escape route by the duergar. This could be of use in the coming Surface Invasion.
