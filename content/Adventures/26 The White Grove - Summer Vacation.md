## Details
- **DM**: Jordan
- **Platform:** Foundry

## Adventure Premise
- Over summer break, Headmaster [[NPCs/The White Grove/Arctur Execlostrabaum]] has challenged the students of [[Places/The White Grove]] to a competitive off-campus scavenger hunt.
- Students who succeed in the scavenger hunt will be given extra commendations in their culminating portfolio, which makes this an exceedingly valuable extra-curricular (if you care about having a successful career as a spellcaster).
