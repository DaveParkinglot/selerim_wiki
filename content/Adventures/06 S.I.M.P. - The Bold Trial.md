# Adventure Premise
- You and your beefcake [[S.I.M.P.]] compatriots are embarking on The Bold Trial, which could lead to your promotion from Frail Manlet to the rank of Bold Beefcake. 
- Survive these 3 trials and live to tell the tale and you will surely be given better responsibilities and the pick of S.I.M.P.'s best mercenary contracts!

# Outcomes
- After absolutely crushing The Bold Trial, the party found that the S.I.M.P. encampment was under attack by undead who had appeared out of nowhere. With the help of Manmeister Ricky Timbers, the new Bold Beefcakes cut a swathe through the undead and destroyed their leader, a deathlock atop a pale horse.
