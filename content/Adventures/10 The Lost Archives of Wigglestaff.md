[[Selerim Worldbuilding/Adventure Handouts/The Lost Archives of Wigglestaff Handout]]

# Details
- **DM**: Jordan
- **Platform:** Foundry
- **Sessions:** 1

# Adventure Premise
- [[NPCs/Tanglewood Peninsula/Dick Gunbarrel]], commander of the [[Crillville Defense Force]] (CDF) has placed a bounty on the head of Ringleader Redtusk, a half-ogre warlord who has suddenly appeared in the region. Investigate what Redtusk is doing on the island of the former gnome Wigglestaff, and bring his head back to [[Places/Crillville]] to make a name for yourself.

# Outcomes
- The rogue goblin mercenary Pissjar was struck down effortlessly in a 5-on-1 fight, though it was more of a firing squad.
- ISIS-T struck down many more goblins and eventually Ringleader Redtusk himself once they located his hideout in an abandoned wizard's archive.
