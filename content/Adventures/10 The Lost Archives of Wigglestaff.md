## Adventure Premise
- Dick Gunbarrel, commander of the Crillville Defense Force (CDF) has placed a bounty on the head of Ringleader Redtusk, a half-ogre warlord who has suddenly appeared in the region. Investigate what Redtusk is doing on the island of the former gnome Wigglestaff, and bring his head back to Crillville to make a name for yourself.

## Outcomes
- The rogue goblin mercenary Pissjar was struck down effortlessly in a 5-on-1 fight, though it was more of a firing squad.
- ISIS-T struck down many more goblins and eventually Ringleader Redtusk himself once they located his hideout in an abandoned wizard's archive.
