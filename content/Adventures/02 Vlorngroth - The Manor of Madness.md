Handouts:
[[Selerim Worldbuilding/Adventure Handouts/Vlorngroth Setting Overview]]
[[Selerim Worldbuilding/Adventure Handouts/Inquisitor's Dossier]]

## Details
- **DM**: Jordan
- **Platform:** Roll20
- **Sessions:** 2

## Adventure Premise
- You will play as a group of Inquisitor Initiates in the city of [[Places/Vlorngroth]].
- Your mission: subdue and extract a resident from Duskveil Asylum, also known as "The Manor of Madness".
- A prophetic vision from Matron Mother Aranaea implies that one asylum resident will be necessary to the coming surface invasion.
- Unfortunately, the prophecy is not too clear on which resident is the prophesied oneâ€¦

## Outcomes
- Despite the misinterpretations of Lolth's prophecy, the Inquisitor Initiates were successful in summoning the draegloth demigod Proklor the Despoiler to the material plane of Selerim, with minimal collateral damage.
- After a trial of wits and blades, Proklor pledged his services to the cause of the Vlorn Dynasty and its High Lord, Jorad Kranicz.
- Dyksin Poesie, the Duergar Barbarian who was initially the leader of the party, accidentally dealt a killing blow to the asylum resident Prince Thalgrim the Desolate.
- Spymaster Valnex warned that anyone who kills a resident would in turn be executed (as the resident could have been the prophesied one).
- Therefore, Dyksin Poesie escaped by stabbing himself with an Underdagger, teleporting himself away from the crime scene.
- Sister Katharine Voidstone was afflicted with a horrible case of Surface Sickness.
