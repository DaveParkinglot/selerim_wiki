# Adventure Premise
- You are travelers on the sailing ship The Dankwood Express, heading west from the Tanglewood Peninsula ([[Places/Crillville]], [[Places/Crabbley]], [[Places/Mitlin]], [[Oasis]], or [[Places/Scrimshaw City]]). Your course is set for many destinations in The Great Delphin Sea ([[Places/Breakwater Cove]], [[Places/Forsyth Keep]], [[Places/The White Grove]], [[Places/Nova Jersaeria]]). Where are you leaving and where are you heading to? And more importantly, why?
- During the journey, you are approached by a goblin cabin boy named [[NPCs/Other/Bootknife]] has a big job coming up out of Breakwater Cove, and that he needs a good crew. The payout seems sizeable, but you'll want to meet this Bootknife fellow firstâ€¦

# Outcomes
- After a run-in with Captain Ghaster, captain of [[Places/Mournholde]] necronaut The Slow Decline, the party was attacked by zombie rats and left for dead.
- Despite the odds, they lived. After arriving at [[Places/Breakwater Cove]], they successfully took a job from the goblin Bootknife at Bone Tavern, becoming his new crew.
- After bullying information about a sickly leviathan from the researcher Krillmort Coloradostein, they defeated Captain Ghaster and his skeleton crew and recovered the coveted leviathan scales from the beached leviathan.
