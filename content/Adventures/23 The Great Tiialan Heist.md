# Adventure Premise
- All through Nova Jersaeria, word has spread that [[Lord Zaldivar]] of the [[Batista]] crime family will be visiting for his nephew Roberto’s birthday gala. Rumors abound that there will be feasts, revelry, and—most importantly—precious gifts to mark the occasion. Some even say that Lord Zaldivar is gifting Roberto a magical Tiialan Stone to celebrate. Be it through your eavesdropping, or word from your less scrupulous acquaintances, you have been informed that one Mr. [[NPCs/Tiialia/Falsus Omnibus]] is conspiring with the rival [[Ruz]] crime family to conduct a heist on this gala and is seeking co-conspirators at the local tavern.
