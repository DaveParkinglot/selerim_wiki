# Adventure Premise
- All through Nova Jersaeria, word has spread that [[Lord Zaldivar Batisa\|Lord Zaldivar]] of the [[Batista]] crime family will be visiting for his nephew Roberto’s birthday gala. Rumors abound that there will be feasts, revelry, and—most importantly—precious gifts to mark the occasion. Some even say that Lord Zaldivar is gifting Roberto a magical Tiialan Stone to celebrate. Be it through your eavesdropping, or word from your less scrupulous acquaintances, you have been informed that one Mr. [[NPCs/Tiialia/Falsus Omnibus]] is conspiring with the rival [[Ruz]] crime family to conduct a heist on this gala and is seeking co-conspirators at the local tavern.

# Outcomes
- [[NPCs/Tiialia/Falsus Omnibus]] gave the adventures hints about how to access the estate of Roberto Batista during the birthday gala.
	- Enter the gardens through the woods. The gardens will be guarded, but ONLY around the central fountain. Swing counterclockwise around the outside and you should be fine—that side of the gardens has been abandoned.
	- I will meet you at the back door to sneak you into the party. The key will be to FIT IN and NOT draw attention to yourself until we have an opportunity for you to slip away.
	- At some point in the night, performers will take requests in the lounge. I will request that they play "[The Tiialan Triumph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGdtkUiKaA8)" – this is a loud and long song that should give you all plenty of time to sneak upstairs, grab the birthday loot, and make a quick escape.
- The adventurers made it through the gardens without attracting attention, although they did have to kill a Giant Constrictor Snake in the abandoned pools of the western gardens. As promised, Falsus met them at the back door and let them in.
- The adventures went through several rounds of festivities, trying to gain information about the Batista estate and the treasures held on the second floor. First, the adventures mingled in the reception hall, eating hors d'oeuvres and trying to fit in. Next, they proceeded to the banquet all, where they tried their best at dancing. The adventurers at this point became concerned that [[Lord Zaldivar Batisa]] may, in fact, be a vampire. After that, they enjoyed dinner with the rest of the guests in the dining room, only slightly making fools of themselves based on where they ended up sitting. Finally, they went to the lounge where "[The Tiialan Triumph]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGdtkUiKaA8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGdtkUiKaA8))" was performed, during which time they snuck away to go upstairs.
- On their way upstairs, they encountered Juice Johnson, who was contracted to cook for the event. He ignored them as they went through the kitchen.
- In a back storeroom, they found [[NPCs/Tiialia/Alejandro Ruz]] tied up and rescued him from his capture. He promised the adventures that they were all now friends of the Ruz family as he fled through a back window.
- The adventurers snuck upstairs to Lord Batista's office to steal the Tiialan Stones. However, they fell into a trap, with [[NPCs/Tiialia/Falsus Omnibus]] stepping out to call them Ruz spies, after which the adventurers were descended upon by [[Mervin 'The Mayor' Bissell]], [[NPCs/Tiialia/Carlos 'Lucky' Luciano]], and a slew of Batista guards.
- They defeated these enemies and acquired loot from Lord Batista's chest, including two Tiialan Stones: [[Tiialan Stone, Protection]] and [[Tiialan Stone, Agility]]. They also found [[Mervin's Letter to Lord Zalvidar Batista]]
- The adventurers cornered [[NPCs/Tiialia/Falsus Omnibus]], who bartered for his life by saying that, if they just knocked him out and left him some of the money from Lord Batista's chest nearby for him to pick up. They decided to let him live by this deal and leapt out of the back window before they could be discovered.
- The adventurers ran off into the woods, hoping to escape with their loot and not knowing how the Batista Family might react to this heist.
