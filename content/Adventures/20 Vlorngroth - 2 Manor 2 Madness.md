# Adventure Premise
- In the subterranean city of [[Places/Vlorngroth]], you serve as a familiar of [[NPCs/Vlorngroth/Count Calloway Duskveil]], a powerful yet reclusive vampire.
- Your master has urgent need of your services—and, almost unbelievably, he has promised to turn one of you into a vampire once his task is complete.
- His ancestral manse, the converted Duskveil Asylum (aka The Manor of Madness) was recently returned to his family holdings by decree of [[High Lord Jorad Kranicz]].
- Some of the asylum inmates oppose this change in ownership, so your master needs you to remove these loathsome squatters before they wreck the place—or worse, find legal representation.

# Outcomes
- Misty Dyrt succeeded in losing the least Sanity score in the manor and ascended to vampiredom.
- Pedgar Barkov was slain by Slurpgluppinous Ooze and the rest of the ooze family during their ooze dinner.
- The asylum wretches and the ooze family were summarily executed and evicted, but other squatters in the Manor of Madness have yet to be dealt with…
