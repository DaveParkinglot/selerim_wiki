## Adventure Premise
- [[Hugh Mann]], El Presidente of Scrimshaw, has vanished from the city on the eve of his own party, the [[Hellnight]] Soirée.
- [[Binky Slivers]], bartender at The High Roller and Mann's fixer, has called you in because of your previous success in eliminating the demonic presence at the Crystal Theatre.
- Binky believes the situation to be grim, and has said as much:  "The El Presidente's absence leaves us open to a hostile takeover by young professionals and barons of hell alike."
- Binky has provided his research into the most important guests: [[Binky Sliver's Hellnight Dossier]].

## Outcomes
- The brave adventurers took up the job of bouncers at the soirée, successfully turning away the Diaboli Non Grata [[Humana]] and [[Billy Bubbler]] with clever deception and favors.
- They were unable to talk down [[Chauncy the Unrepentant]] from a fight, but soundly defeated him and sent him back to the Lower Planes, 
- They cleverly pitted the entourages of [[Baron Neffery]] and [[Pazuzu]] against each other while eating hors d'oeuvres.
- Towards the end of the evening, they sparked a fight in the ballroom which erupted into a brutal full blown melee.
- The entourages of both [[Pazuzu]] and the [[Baron Neffery|Baron]] were severely weakened, and their new Fiend Feud will prevent either of them from initiating a hostile takeover of [[Hugh Mann]]'s Fiend Franchise in [[Scrimshaw City]].
