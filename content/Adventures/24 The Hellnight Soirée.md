## Details
- **DM**: Jordan
- **Platform:** Foundry
- **Sessions:** 1

## Adventure Premise
- [[NPCs/Scrimshaw City/Hugh Mann]], El Presidente of Scrimshaw, has vanished from the city on the eve of his own party, the [[Selerim Worldbuilding/Holidays/Hellnight]] Soirée.
- [[NPCs/Scrimshaw City/Binky Slivers]], bartender at The High Roller and Mann's fixer, has called you in because of your previous success in eliminating the demonic presence at the Crystal Theatre.
- Binky believes the situation to be grim, and has said as much:  "The El Presidente's absence leaves us open to a hostile takeover by young professionals and barons of hell alike."
- Binky has provided his research into the most important guests: [[Selerim Worldbuilding/Adventure Handouts/Binky Sliver's Hellnight Dossier]].

## Outcomes
- The brave adventurers took up the job of bouncers at the soirée, successfully turning away the Diaboli Non Grata [[NPCs/Other/Humana]] and [[NPCs/Other/Billy Bubbler]] with clever deception and favors.
- They were unable to talk down [[NPCs/Other/Chauncy the Unrepentant]] from a fight, but soundly defeated him and sent him back to the Lower Planes, 
- They cleverly pitted the entourages of [[NPCs/Other/Baron Neffery]] and [[NPCs/Other/Pazuzu]] against each other while eating hors d'oeuvres.
- Towards the end of the evening, they sparked a fight in the ballroom which erupted into a brutal full blown melee.
- The entourages of both [[NPCs/Other/Pazuzu]] and the [[NPCs/Other/Baron Neffery\|Baron]] were severely weakened, and their new Fiend Feud will prevent either of them from initiating a hostile takeover of [[NPCs/Scrimshaw City/Hugh Mann]]'s Fiend Franchise in [[Locations/Scrimshaw City]].
