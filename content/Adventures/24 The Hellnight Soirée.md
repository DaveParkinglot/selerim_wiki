## Adventure Premise
- [[NPCs/Scrimshaw City/Hugh Mann]], El Presidente of Scrimshaw, has vanished from the city on the eve of his own party, the [[Holidays/Hellnight]] Soirée.
- [[NPCs/Scrimshaw City/Binky Slivers]], bartender at The High Roller and Mann's fixer, has called you in because of your previous success in eliminating the demonic presence at the Crystal Theatre.
- Binky believes the situation to be grim, and has said as much:  "The El Presidente's absence leaves us open to a hostile takeover by young professionals and barons of hell alike."
