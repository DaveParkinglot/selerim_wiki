## Adventure Premise
- Rumors have been spreading of a pack of wolves roaming near the village of Grainsford. Some have even claimed to see a figure riding one of the wolves. Investigate this strange incident and the townsfolk will see to it you are rewarded for their efforts.

## Outcomes
- Of the fledgling Grainsford Saviors, Mylleria was the only survivor.
- Mylleria skulks back to Grainsford, her pride broken by her defeat. She hears howling through the forest as she leaves. Her two companions both left behind, she can only imagine what the scene of carnage is there. When she returns she tells of the sacrifice of her party members, a solemn mood comes over the Red Plow.
