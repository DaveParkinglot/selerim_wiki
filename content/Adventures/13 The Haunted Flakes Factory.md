## Details
- **DM**: Jordan
- **Platform:** Foundry

## Adventure Premise
- Halloween One Shot
- You are all attending a beach bonfire party on the outskirts of the town of [[Crabbley]], enjoying beverages and scary ghost stories. Unfortunately, one of these spooky tales will be more than just a storyâ€¦

## Outcomes
- After a long night of revelry and a run in with some very repentant brigands, the party and [[Li'l Carlos Dunlap]] (the most popular kid in town) snuck into the old abandoned Bondoon Flakes Factory Megaplex. They fended off zombified factory workers, fought against the tyranny of capitalism, and ended the lives of Old Mr. Bondoon's three cereal mascots: Billy Basilisk, Garry Griffon, and Donny the Displacer Beast.
- "The Smashing Dunlaps" will go down in both the history books and the yearbook of Crabbley High as the first group to sneak into the haunted factory and return to tell the tale.
