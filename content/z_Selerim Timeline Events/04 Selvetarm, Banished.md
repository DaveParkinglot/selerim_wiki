{"publish":true,"title":"Selvetarm, Banished","description":"Triumphant at last, The Seldarine banish Selvetarm to The Abyss, while his surviving followers flee beyond sight, into the depths of the world. Before departing, the elf gods restore the war-scarred world and bequeath [[The Inhabitable Lands]] to Selvetarm's former slaves—a diverse multitude, stolen from countless worlds.
