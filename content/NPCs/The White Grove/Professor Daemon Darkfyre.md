![[daemon_darkfyre.webp\|300]]

# Overview
- The newest professor to be employed by The White Grove, a very peculiar hire. No one knows where Daemon hails from, but he is surprisingly adept at teaching infernal classes including Intro to Infernal and Intermediate Infernal.
- He is constantly followed by a hulking suit of armor that seems to be animated, but for some reason the armor is constantly breathing heavily and humming to itself.
- Daemon insists that students call him Daemon, and not "Professor Darkfyre".
