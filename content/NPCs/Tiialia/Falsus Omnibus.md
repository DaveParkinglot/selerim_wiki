# Overview
It seems that, while Falsus Omnibus in theory serves the Batiste family, he mostly just serves himself. He originally suggested that a gang of misfits conduct a heist on a birthday party at the Batiste family manor, and then betrayed these adventures, and then bargained with them to spare him in exchange for him lying about who they were (suggesting to the Batiste's that they were Ruz family bandits).
