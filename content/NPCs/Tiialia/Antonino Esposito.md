# Overview
- Last known remnant of the blood of the Old Kings of Tiialia.
- Sole survivor of the Midsummer Massacre, last remaining member of the once powerful [[The Esposito Family]].
- He was great friends with [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/Francis Greenstrider De Luca]]â€™s father Marco, before his death at the hands of [[Factions/The Kingdom of Tiialia/The Fanto-Domingo Family]].
- He worked as a spy with Marco De Luca when they were younger
	- "Nino" was the fourth son of the Esposito family, and never had a thought of becoming a leader within the family
	- He is last member of his family, and he has the Fanto-Domingos to thank for everything
## [[Adventures/00 The High Rollers Campaign\|The High Rollers Campaign]]
- He still held some sway, and had been working as a Tiialan spymaster out of his family's vineyard, supporting [[Factions/The Kingdom of Tiialia/The Landucci Family]] and [[Factions/The Kingdom of Tiialia/The Adonzio Family]].
- Despite this, [[NPCs/Villains/Lord Draco Landucci]] schemed to undermine his authority, planning to give ownership of the Esposito Vineyard to [[NPCs/Tanglewood Peninsula/Trilbee Rampo]].
- [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/The High Rollers]], while adventuring in the Forsaken Expanse, intercepted Trilbee and unwittingly forced him to cede ownership of the vineyard to them.
- After some time working with [[The High Rollers]], Nino discovered his true ancestry, overthrew the tyrant [[NPCs/Villains/Lord Draco Landucci]], and rightfully took the crown of [[Places/Tiialia]] for himself.
