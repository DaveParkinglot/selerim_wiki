### Overview
- Shemcriz is a sturdy, thick, and hapless kobold who gets in way over his head way too often.
- He originally came to the surface with a scouting party from Vlorngroth, but overstayed his welcome in the distillery of the Esposito Vineyard, where he was captured by [[The High Rollers]].
- Later, he was found by The High Rollers (and luckily saved) while being sacrificed to a yuan-ti god.
