### Overview
Once the king of a nearly forgotten dwarvish empire (dead for ~250 years), Geblorgurin is highly regarded amongst all the peoples of Selerim, and amongst adventurers because of the many treasure-laden monuments he left behind.

-
	- It is said that these monuments contain great artifacts of power, but the monuments are said to test those who enter them. Only the worthy may wield the artifacts Geblorgurin left behind.
	- Dwarves (especially those of Geblorgurin's time) are fiercely protective of their belongings in life, but in death they desire nothing more than to have their belongings used by worthy individuals
- Geblorgurin was the first wielder of [[Jordan's Notes/DM Notes/The Gem of Eyes\|gem of eyes]]
	- From the shell of a Marut that fell from sky, Geblorgurin pried the gem.
	- The dead Marut's shell, Geblorgurin used to forge his armor.

Notes from [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/Clint Weapon\|Clint Weapon's]] hour long meeting in Mitlin with Melvin the elvish wizard.
  [[Jordan's Notes/DM Notes/The Gem of Eyes\|Gem of Eyes]]
- The gem was originally found in the crater of a fallen star by Geblorgurin himself
- He used it to great effect in the never ending fight against incursions from the Vlorn
- Clint would know that the Vlorn Dynasty is a faction in the Underdark led by the drow (dark elves)
- The Gem of Eyes was rediscovered by the Deepmine Dwarves when they excavated/plundered one of Geblorgurin's many monuments
- Garm Deepmine seems to have sold it a man in Scrimshaw, who later became the powerful necromance now known as "The Master"
Geblorgurin Lore
- He was the last great king of dwarves, and he has been dead for well over two centuries
- Notably, he forged an alliance with the gnomes and elves of the Tanglewood in order to finally push the Vlorn Dynasty's trolls back into the Underdark
- Dwarves are fiercely protective of their belongings in life, but in death they desire nothing more than to have their belongings used by worthy individuals
- Geblorgurin likely has other monuments meant to challenge the worthy, so that they may earn the powerful items forged by his people
- A remnant of Geblorgurin's spirit is left in his armor (he is super aggressive)
The meeting ended early because Melvin had to go investigate reports of Vlorn Trolls near the Forsaken Expanse.
