![[z_assets/dr_drendle.png|300]]
### Overview
- The former [[Crabbley]] alchemist, before he gave up his mortality in favor of undeath. He was using the Gem of Eyes in a dark ritual at the Aldwood Lighthouse before he was slain by [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/The High Rollers]].
- Despite this, his ritual summoned an eldritch storm and turned the surrounding water to ice. A  somewhat convenient paper trail made it clear that he was working for someone calling themselves "The Master"...
- Somehow, Drendle returned during [[NPCs/Deceased/Master Effree Jypstein]]'s invasiion of [[The Kingdom of Tiialia]].
- He was slain by [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/The High Rollers]] and their unlikely ally [[NPCs/Other/Carbuckle Duskshot]] while he was spreading his plagues through the town of [[Scallion]] in northern Tiialia.
