### Overview
- After The High Rollers assembled the three Gems of Eyes they combined into a singular, larger eye. Around this eye, Baj the Unerring's physical form was able to manifest.
- Somehow, Baj was killed and his Gold Plate shattered prior to the reign of Geblorgurin, King of the Dwarves over 250 years ago.
- The nigh-unstoppable inevitables serve a singular purpose: they enforce contracts forged in the Hall of Concordance in the city of Sigil.
