# Overview
- Once the king of the dwarves before his passing, Geblorgurin is highly regarded amongst all the peoples of Selerim, and amongst adventurers because of the many treasure-laden monuments he left behind.
- It is said that these monuments contain great artifacts of power, but the monuments are said to test those who enter them. Only the worthy may wield the artifacts Geblorgurin left behind.
- Dwarves (especially those of Geblorgurin's time) are fiercely protective of their belongings in life, but in death they desire nothing more than to have their belongings used by worthy individuals
- Geblorgurin was the first wielder of the powerful artifact [[Jordan's Notes/DM Notes/The Gem of Eyes]].
	- From the shell of a Marut that fell from sky, Geblorgurin pried the gem.
	- Of the dead Marut's shell, Geblorgurin did forge his armor and his kingdom.

> Notes from [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/Clint Weapon\|Clint Weapon's]] hour long meeting in [[Places/Mitlin]] with Melvin the elvish wizard.
> - [[Jordan's Notes/DM Notes/The Gem of Eyes]] was originally found in the crater of a fallen star by Geblorgurin himself
> - He used it to great effect in the never ending fight against incursions from the Vlorn
> - Clint would know that [[Factions/The Vlorn Dynasty]] is a faction in the Underdark led by the drow (dark elves)
> - [[plundered one of Geblorgurin's many monuments
> - [[NPCs/Scrimshaw City/Garm Deepmine]] seems to have sold it a man in Scrimshaw, who later became the powerful necromance now known as "The Master"
> Geblorgurin Lore
> - He was the last great king of dwarves, and he has been dead for well over two centuries
> - Notably, he forged an alliance with the gnomes and elves of the Tanglewood in order to finally push [[Factions/The Vlorn Dynasty]]'s trolls back into the Underdark
> - Dwarves are fiercely protective of their belongings in life, but in death they desire nothing more than to have their belongings used by worthy individuals
> - Geblorgurin likely has other monuments meant to challenge the worthy, so that they may earn the powerful items forged by his people
> - A remnant of Geblorgurin's spirit is left in his armor (he is super aggressive)
> The meeting ended early because Melvin had to go investigate reports of Vlorn Trolls near the Forsaken Expanse.
