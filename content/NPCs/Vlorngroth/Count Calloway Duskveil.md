### Overview
- His nickname was once The Midnight Marquis, from his time in the Inquisitors
- His family once owned Duskveil Asylum (aka The Manor of Madness) before it was given over to the cause of the Vlorn Dynasty
- While he is friends with powerful folk, he himself is not nearly as ambitious, preferring to keep to himself
- He is old friends with [[High Lord Jorad Kranicz]], and he may have secretly turned him into a vampire so that the High Lord can continue to rule beyond the natural life of a drowâ€¦
- He is a relative of the former Inquisitor turned bounty hunter [[NPCs/Vlorngroth/Carbuckle Duskshot]], who dropped the Veil in favor of the Shot. He is probably his uncle because I think that is very cool
