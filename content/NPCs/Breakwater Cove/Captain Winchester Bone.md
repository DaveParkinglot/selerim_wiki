# Overview
Once a renowned pirate captain, he now owns Bone Tavern in [[Places/Breakwater Cove]]. Loves to recount his days of yore to whoever will listen.
- He has sailed with many crews aboard many ships, but he is most known for his time aboard the Leaky Bucket. 
- At some point, he had to fight half his crew and his first mate [[Sharky Dolphino]] over some relics they plundered from a ship bound for [[Places/Mournholde\|Mournholde]]. 
	- The following is Bone's accounting of the events that led to the end of "Bone and Sharky's Crew":
	    - Sharky, being an orphan cast out of Tiialia, wanted to use powerful artifacts they looted to get revenge on those who had wronged him
	    - Bone had no choice but to mutiny, and he used one of the artifacts on Sharky and his supporters. 
	    - "Yarrr… lost over half me crew that day. Twas a terrible time."
	    - "Yarrr… The artifact were a small vase with a skull on it… still remember the way the eyes gleamed, lookin up at me… blasted the ol' skin right from their bones and sucked in their souls to boot"
	    - "Yarr, I chucked that strange vase right in the ocean on me way back home, suppose it's still there buried beneath the waves"
