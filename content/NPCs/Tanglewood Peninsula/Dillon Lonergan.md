### Overview
- Dillon has spent most of his life serving the [[The Vlorn Dynasty]], mostly against his will and at the tip of a drow's knife. 
- He was recently brought onto a project to create a doomsday machine to reclaim the Tanglewood Peninsula for the Vlorn, but that project recently fell apart due to intervention from [[The High Rollers]] intervention. 
- At Eros' urging, Dillon turned over a new leaf and became the local artificer in the town of [[Crabbley]].
- He assisted the Cronium Gnomes in repairing their broken teleporter, which almost never malfunctions now.
