# Overview
> "Well hey fellas!" 

## [[Adventures/00 The High Rollers Campaign\|The High Rollers Campaign]]
- Bopus was a gnome diplomat living in The Cronium Caves, a gnome commune beneath [[Crabbley]]. The Cronium gnomes preferred to stay hidden, until their commune was invaded by kobolds. Bopus bravely went to Crabbley in search of help, and recruited [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/The High Rollers]] to assist his people. They dragged their feet for a while, but eventually they took up Bopus' quest and helped retake the Cronium Caves from the kobolds.
- After the repatriation of the Cronium Caves, the best gnomish scientists and a reformed [[NPCs/Tanglewood Peninsula/Dillon Lonergan]] finished the teleporter that the gnomes were working on prior to the kobold incursion.
- During a routine teleporter test, Bopus was flung into the far reaches of the Astral Sea, where he made briefly contact with the vestige of a dead god. Upon his return, a strange blue hatted clone of Bopus manifested itself.
- Some time later, Bopus contacted the [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/The High Rollers]] mid-adventure to request help testing the teleporter. They travelled to a strangely similar, yet different material plane and fought some villains there.

## [[Adventures/05 The Hunt for Pill'Grim\|The Hunt for Pill'Grim]]
- Bopus recruited brave adventurers to assist in hunting down a villainous turkey automaton created by [[NPCs/Tanglewood Peninsula/Dillon Lonergan]] in this multiversal romp.

## [[Adventures/22 The Crimsonclaw Bounty\|The Crimonclaw Bounty]]
- While carousing at the Crab Claw Inn, Bopus provided the details and the map of Old Crimsonclaw's suspected location to a fledgling adventuring party.

## [[Selerim 5K]]
- In the [[Selerim 5K]] setting, Bopus is known as [[The Machine God]]. Many bots are made in his image, such as the many Bopus Bot versions.
