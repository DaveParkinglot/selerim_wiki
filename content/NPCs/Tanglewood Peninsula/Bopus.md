### Overview
"Well hey fellas!" 
Gnome questgiver and diplomat who lives in The Cronium Caves, a gnome commune.

- Bopus was transfused with a shard of a dead god during one of the gnome's teleporter experiments, during which he was briefly flung into to the far reaches of the Astral Sea.
- Bopus may not even be aware of this, but this is why he has been infused with powers that no gnome has known.
- This is also why Bopus can manifest the grumpy dark mirror of himself, [[NPCs/Tanglewood Peninsula/Dopus]].
- In the [[Selerim 5K]] setting, Bopus is known as [[The Machine God]].
