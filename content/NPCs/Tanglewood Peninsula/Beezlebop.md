# Overview

## [[Adventures/00 The High Rollers Campaign\|The High Rollers Campaign]]
- As an ally of [[NPCs/Villains/Malmstein the Tangler]], he helped create freakishly mutated monsters in his huge spooky mansion. 
- [[NPCs/Tanglewood Peninsula/Sleeto Van Coof]] inadvertently foiled his operations when he attempted to rob the mansion, but most of his party was turned to slag in Beezlebop's slagma traps. 
- [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/The High Rollers]] encountered a Living Portrait of Beezlebop himself when they helped Sleeto and young [[NPCs/Scrimshaw City/Hoary Boulder]] finish the heist of the mansion, though the actual Beezlebop was nowhere to be found...

## [[Adventures/22 The Crimsonclaw Bounty\|The Crimsonclaw Bounty]] 
- Beezlebop appeared to be active again, as he created the mutant manticore "Old Crimsonclaw".
