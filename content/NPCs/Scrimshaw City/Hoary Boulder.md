[[D&D/One Shots/Arby's Sauce]]
Downtime between Tiialia and Vlorn arcs:
- Created all the tournament brackets for Hugh Mann’s Midwinter Invitational at The Pit, and also taught a course on Bracketology at Scrimshaw Area Community College
- Unwittingly exchanged the only copy of Arby’s Sauce and 18 years of his life to a mad fey, making him 17 again. Arby's secret recipe has not been recovered, and Loeb is unsure how Scrimshaw’s child labor laws apply to Hoary now
- Helped Loeb and Arby salvage Tavernstool memorabilia from Lord Davos Portnoir’s ransacked mansion, then sold it to Arno Rickshir to keep The Spicy Meatball afloat
