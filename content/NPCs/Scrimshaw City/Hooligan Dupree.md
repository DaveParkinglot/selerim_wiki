### Overview
- One of [[Eros]]' friends from before he joined [[The High Rollers]].
- Tired of being a lazy bum with too much time to party, Hooligan tried to become an adventurer.
- This led him to join [[Tavernstool]], and he couldn't handle the amount of hazing. He was, fortunately, saved by The High Rollers before all the hazing killed him.
- Now he works at The Spicy Meatball while he builds his career as a salt spitter (rapper) in [[Scrimshaw City]].
