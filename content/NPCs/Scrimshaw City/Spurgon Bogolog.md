- Lead singer of Crag Delta. For someone with such sticky fingers he sure can play the lyre!
- One of the 3 members of Crag Delta. They've played venues from [[Crabbley]] to [[Selerim Wiki/Locations/The Kingdom of Tiialia/Nova Jersaeria]], but when they're not touring they live in [[Scrimshaw City]] and play gigs at The Pit.
- His stage name is "The Spurg".
