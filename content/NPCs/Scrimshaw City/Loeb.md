### Overview
- Originally, Loeb was [[Tadeusz]]'s blood hunter battle buddy who was lost after their voyage to kill a kraken went wrong.
- Like all blood hunters, he is steely on the surface, with a bestial fury underneath. He uses this very effectively in managing [[The Spicy Meatball]] and all of its misfit workers in the absence of [[Tadeusz]] and the rest of [[The High Rollers]].
