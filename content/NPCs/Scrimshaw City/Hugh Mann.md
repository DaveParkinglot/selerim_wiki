# Overview
- A devil from one of the Nine Hells who isn't actually all that bad.
- Hundreds of years ago, Hugh and his friends were thrown away as battlefield fodder by the man who would become the devil [[NPCs/Villains/Lord Davos Portnoir]].
- He adventured with [[The High Rollers]] for a time, and eventually had his vengeance by deposing [[NPCs/Villains/Lord Davos Portnoir]].
- With Portnoir deposed, Hugh Mann now reigns as El Presidente of [[Scrimshaw City]], and he has sole ownership of [[Tavernstool]], Portnoir's old company.
- His status as a devil is, at this point, widely known in Scrimshaw.
