# Overview
- Once a gladiator school owner, Usus became like a father to [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/Otieno]] before Otieno's adventuring career took off. Unfortunately, he lost all his money betting on Otieno and disowned him... a very reasonable choice.
- He also was the former manager of The Pit before [[NPCs/Villains/Lord Davos Portnoir]] took over. After this, Usus lost his job for a time. He eventually came begging back to Otieno for a job and started working at [[The Spicy Meatball]].
- Few people know this, but a young Usus tried to become a blood hunter at [[Places/Forsyth Keep]], but he failed out.
