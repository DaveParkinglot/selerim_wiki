- He still holds some sway, and has become a Tiialan spymaster, supporting [[The Landucci Family]] and [[The Adonzio Family]]
- He was friends with [[Francis Greenstrider De Luca]]â€™s father
- They were spies together back when they were younger
	- "Nino" was the fourth son of the Esposito family, and never had a thought of becoming a leader within the family
