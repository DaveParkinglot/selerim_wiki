![[The World of Selerim/z_assets/ephram.png]]
- Effree was a wizard, and part of an adventuring party with Blackhorn the Barbarian and Geelayne the Cleric
- As they grew in power, Effree became secretive of his purposes and began to frequently consort with his patron, Myrkul the Lord of Bones
- Geelayne was killed on one of their adventures and rather than "wasting" the Scroll of Resurrection, Effree opted to use necromantic magic he had just learned to bring her back.
	- Geelayne became a shade of herself for months, and Effree and Blackhorn became estranged.
	- Geelayne eventually regained a fraction of her former power and struck out with rangers from Mitlin to end the threat that Effree posed to the world, but she failed and was once again resurrected by Effree, this time as a banshee
	
- Since their party disbanded, Effree became a noble in Scrimshaw for some time, where he procured the [[D&D/DM Notes/The Gem of Eyes\|Gem of Eyes]] from Garm Deepmine.
	- After this, he became reclusive, eventually moving to his family's ancestral islands.
	-  Since then, he has been collecting other powerful magical artifacts left behind by Geblorgurin such as the Ioun Stone and the Manual of Flesh Golems that he carries on his person
- He believes Clint Weapon will join him in the end because the way he sees it, the remnant of his power in the Gem of Eyes has surely corrupted Clint



#### In-game notes:
**Tadeusz Research Notes**
- The Master is powerful necromancer whose name has all but been forgotten, known to live on a small island somewhere in the greater Boater's Bay region.

- There are tales of a once benevolent man, well respected and loved by many, driven mad by the need to perfect his own flesh and gain personal power. It is clear that he is not allied with any cause except for his own, and that does not care much for the goings-on of the peninsula.

- He was good friends with a man named Blackhorn, and Blackhorn often visited him for months at a time. These two had a falling out at some point, but over what is not entirely clear. Blackhorn was once a fierce fighter who made his coin in Scrimshaw, fighting in The Pit.

- Some time in the recent past, this once benevolent man is said to have procured a priceless gem from a dwarven mining company. Some eyewitness accounts from the man's last public appearance many years ago indicate that he fused the gem into himself in an attempt to become ageless and all powerful.

INTEL FROM SLEETO:

- Blackhorn's last known location is a village located on the northeast end of the Tanglewood Peninsula, a region which has become a forsaken desert.
- Blackhorn was once known as a barbarian of extreme prowess, far more powerful than anyone in the party (at level 4).
- It seems that The Master is far more powerful than even Blackhorn.
- Blackhorn would know or have info about The Master's location, perhaps even a map.
