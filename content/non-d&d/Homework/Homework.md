- the critical voice
	- pick a 24 hour period of time and count how many times you find yourself in your head listening to your critical voice
	- critical voice is the voice that tells you something isn't going to work, second guess yourself, etc.
- how do you manage triggered feelings
	- bring examples of what style you are
	- 3 styles
		- distracting by being busy
		- repress/dismiss feelings, "sit on it"
		- make decisions
-  the blank screen
	- who do you observe that approaches you that you do not end up feeling fine afterwards
- where do I feel my feelings?
	- getting physically triggered: roll eyes, walk out of room
	- observe how you react when you hear the critical voice, manage your triggered feelings, or feel disrupted by others
		- how do you ignite physically

Session 2
- Learn where you ignite physically
- Learn how to go through your feelings first and then think second
- It is never one triggered feeling that is the problem
	- Past situations and feelings about a person can arise
- non-triggered vs triggered
- Active listening
- When you are triggered by the critical voice or other people
	- Shift and notice your physical reaction to the disruption
	- Drop and go to "the blank screen"
- All week long when you hear a dialogue in your head/the critical voice
	- Instead of lighting up physically, shift and notice where you ignite physically
	- Go to the blank screen and use the technique from the session
	- If you hear any simple words after you drop to the blank screen, take note of them
	- Don't immediately react, take time to shift & drop before responding
		- Don't make immediate responses, take time to think and mull it over
	- Settle things and don't spin on them, creating tension and anxiety
Session 3
- Drop to blank screen and make a decision about what to say
- Or wait if you can't think about what to say or do
-
