- Originally, The Inhabitable Lands of Selerim were select areas that were unaffected by the raging arcane fallout resulting from the nameless war between [[The Seldarine]] and [[The Dark Seldarine]]. 
- Folk of Selerim aptly call these destroyed areas [[The Uninhabitable Lands]], but they have never been mapped because they are both uninhabitable and often deadly to anyone who treads there.
- Unfortunately for everyone involved, the [[Selerim Worldbuilding/Lore/Darkwells]] erupting long ago also flooded much of The Inhabitable Lands, further reducing the scope of the world.
