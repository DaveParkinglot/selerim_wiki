- Domain of [[NPCs/Legends/Galgitch, The Afterking]]
- A curse left on the land by a long dead lich means that nothing that dies in Ghoulfen Island stays dead, unless the creature so chooses to forego the "opportunity" to live in death
- [[Places/Mournholde]], the city of the dead, has become a bastion for those who would prefer to live in death
	- It is not uncommon for an elderly or sick person to attempt the journey to [[Places/Mournholde]], before their time is up...
	- For those who cannot afford the expensive journey to [[Places/Mournholde]], there is a chance to win free passage aboard the [[Selerim Worldbuilding/Lore/The Necronaut of Mournholde]] via a lottery system
