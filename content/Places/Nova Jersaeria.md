### Overview
- The greatest city of this age, the Tiialan capital city has grown greatly since it was founded with the help of [[NPCs/Deceased/Geblorgurin the Grand]] some 250 years ago.
- The line of the old Tiialan Kings was thought to have been snuffed out with King Seraphino's death at the First Siege of Corrodreth, during the decades long Serpent Wars. 
- Tiialia was without a true king of royal lineage until [[NPCs/Tiialia/Antonino Esposito]]'s true heritage was discovered by [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/Francis Greenstrider De Luca\|Francis "Frankie" Greenstrider]] of The High Rollers. 
- With this knowledge, the traitor [[NPCs/Deceased/Lord Draco Landucci]] and his puppet King Adonzio were thwarted and deposed, respectively.
