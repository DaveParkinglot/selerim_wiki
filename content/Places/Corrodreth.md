### Overview
- Known in these times as "The Salted City", the desolate ruins of Corrodreth are talked of in hushed tones by citizens of [[Places/Tiialia]].
- Corrodreth was built at the height of the [[Selerim Worldbuilding/Events/Generations' War]], but the empire that built it collapsed after the [[Selerim Worldbuilding/Lore/Darkwells]] flooded much of [[Places/The Inhabitable Lands]].
- The ancient city is now a salted wasteland, sparking with magical energy and planar rifts.
- At the conclusion of the [[Selerim Worldbuilding/Events/Serpent Wars]], the enraged Tiialans laid siege to the city, destroying and salting it to ensure that no green thing would again grow in Corrodreth.
- Much of the city was left as is, as the destruction wrought by the Tiialan artillery mages was devastating. 
- It is said that the yuan-ti warlocks summoned an eldritch entity to the city in its twilight hour, but it would not serve, and so it remains buried in the deepest chambers of the ruined city.
