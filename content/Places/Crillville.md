### Overview
- Crillville is a dreary fishing town on the upper reaches of the Tanglewood Peninsula. It rains frequently in Crillville due to the weather patterns in the northern parts of Boater's Bay.
- Crillville is closely allied with its sister town, [[Places/Crabbley]], which was founded more recently by folk originally from Crillville.
- The town is protected by [[NPCs/Tanglewood Peninsula/Dick Gunbarrel]], his paladins of Tyr, and the brave members of the [[Crillville Defense Force]] (CDF).
- Since the terrorist attacks committed by [[The Tanglers]], both Crillville and [[Places/Crabbley]] joined forces to create the [[Tanglewood Defense Council]].
