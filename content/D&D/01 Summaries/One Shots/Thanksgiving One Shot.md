- Your character might live in Crabbley or they might just be passing through. Either way, they have decided to take a job from a tavern’s notice board, posted by one “Bopus”. The notice states the following:
	- Many automatons created by the renowned inventor Dillon Lonergan malfunctioned under mysterious circumstances last week, wreaking havoc across all of Crabbley.
	- The notice also mentions a large bounty on the head of the dastardly villain “Pill’Grim”, who is believed to be the perpetrator of this terrible crime.
	- Meet Bopus at the Crab Claw Inn for more information.
- Should you succeed on Bopus’ quest, the bounty and the local fame would surely turn your life around.
