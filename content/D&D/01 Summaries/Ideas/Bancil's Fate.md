- Bancil will be found chained to the wall of the Garrison of Legions, forced to watch the slaughter of the Tiialans in the garrison (aka NEW VLORNGROTH), missing his right arm (like Hurin from lotr)

Showdown with Proklor
- Bancil was one of 5 powerful individuals sent by King Nino to treat with The Vlorn, secretly they had plans to banish Proklor the Despoiler from the material plane of Selerim
- They failed and were all killed or captured except for Stiago Zabata, a war cleric of Tyr who was gravely injured before he casted Word of Recall, trying to get everyone out, but he wasn't able to reach his fellow party members when he cast the spell, which teleported him back to the Temple of Tyr in Nova Jersaeria
	- Proklor resisted all 3 banishment spells cast on him, and the party had to resort to fighting him. They were gravely outmatched in this fight
- Bancil Nobeltrim was in this party. Stiago Zabata saw him fighting Proklor, even cleaving through two of the beast's four arms with a divine smite that Stiago swears was guided by The Maimed God himself
- Despite these heroics, the battle quickly turned against Stiago's fellow party members as Proklor set upon them with his foul demonic power. Proklor slew all members of the party except for Bancil, who stood his ground and cried for justice from the heavens. I tried to get him out, but he was knocked away by Proklor before Stiago's Word of Recall finished casting
