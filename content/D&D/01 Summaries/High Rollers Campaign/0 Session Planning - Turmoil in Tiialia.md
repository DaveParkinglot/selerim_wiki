Session 49
- Recap of last 2 sessions:
	- Used bag of holding + tiialan recall scroll after celebrating New Dawn eve in Scrimshaw
	- Arrived at an empty and seemingly abandoned Tiialan vineyard in the countryside, shortly after midnight
	- Found Yournblub Cromstone in chimney, hiding from the Vlorn who had enslaved him. Got info from him:
		- A Vlorn raiding party came from "the surface hole", broke into the estate and took the servants as slaves
		-  The surface hole is at another vineyard several miles away in the countryside. With the prisoners in shackles, the raiding party will be moving slowly
		- One of the leaders of the raiding party is a kobold warlock who holds a small toy
	- After contending with several traps, some set by the Vlorn and some set by the estate's original owner, took a short rest upstairs
	- During this rest, Stinkpiss the Dire Troll came out of the basement with his lizards
	- P3360 and Yournblub were slain in the fighting, but Stinkpiss was eventually defeated. Found Stinkpiss' treasure in the basement
	- The drunken swolbold
		- Talked to Pepperboli/Otieno in draconic. Like Yournblub, he too snuck away to the wine shed... to have some drinks
		- Revealed that there are 5 lightly armored drow scouts, 2 drow elite warriors, 2 duergar mind masters, and 1 kobold warlock (Ashal Fractilian) in the raiding party. The warlock imprisoned a gleaming Tiialan paladin as a small collectible trophy and intends to gift him to his patron (Tzastis, the Collector)
		- Also revealed the secret to the trap in the office (tap bear nose 3 times)
	- Returned to the office, disarmed the traps, discovered a chest with some loot, and the Personal Effects of Antonino Esposito, including 2 important notes
		- The first note revealed a link between Antonino and Marco De Luca (Frankie's father), who died ... 25 years ago?
		- The second note includes instructions for whoever takes ownership of the estate in his absence, originally intended to be Trilbee Rampo before you intervened in the business deals on Landucci's Yacht in the Forsaken Expanse
	- Did some looting, and went upstairs to do a little more looting, where you found a small deep gnome covered in a threadbare blanket, fast asleep... which is where we are now
	
	
Session 50
- Level 10 after long rest
- Bedmund / Topaz Spell Gem ruling
- Item attunements
- Sir Chauncy praises the party as heroes and says they simply must come to Nova Jersaeria with him to inform King Antonio Adonzio of the Vlorn attacks
- On the way, encounter a hurt draegloth and a grick
	- Draegloth delivers a proclamation from High Lord Kranicz of the Vlorn:
		- Tell whoever calls themself ruler of this land that they must send an envoy to the Vlorn capital city of Vlorngroth within a month, or Proklor the Despoiler, Prince of Draegloths will emerge from the Underdark and begin ravaging the entirety of this kingdom
- Francis' vision of a wolf during long rest
	- If he becomes a wolf while wearing his amulet, he sees through the eyes of his father, who was both a druid and a rogue (spymaster)
	- Read the following:
		- First, you see an image of this same wolf, wearing the same amulet you wear on his neck. The wolf also has a pouch tied around its neck. You see it slink past a two guards and dig its way under a gated compound. It stealthily creeps towards an antiquated, weathered building (one that you recognize from your mother's descriptions of the great Tiialan capital Nova Jersaeria). It is The Grand Lineage Archives of Tiialia.
		- Now, you see the wolf runs straight at the wall, and begins to run up it. Just as it begins to lose momentum, it shrinks down to become a spider, which enters a small crack next to a second story window
		- Now your view shifts to inside the building, where you see the spider crawling horizontally across a dusty book shelf. It stops crawling once it reaches a book with a thick leathery spine, and transforms once again, this time into a small chimpanzee. 
		- From the pouch arounds its neck the chimpanzee produces a green vial and quickly gulps it down. The chimp looks uncomfortable for a second and begins to retch, accidentally dropping the glass vial onto the ground, where it loudly shatters. At this, the guards outside the building are roused and you hear the clamor of shouts, and of footsteps on pavement.
		- The chimpanzee chokes back the retching, seemingly brought on by the green vial. It throws the book with the thick leathery spine into the bag, then grabs a second heavy book, which it throws at the window, breaking it.
		- Finally, the chimpanzee transforms into a hawk and flies out the broken window with the pouch around its neck
			- Francis would know the limits of druidkind, and that only archdruids can wild shape more than twice a day. Seems like this vial might allow a druid to overextend itself and wild shape extra times...

Session 51:
- Definitive level 10 levels ups!
	- Clint new wild magic rage table?
	- Otieno aberrant dragonmark flaw / optional boon
- Describe everyone better, their looks, weapons, armor, etc. Chauncy is a dashing platinum blonde paladin!
- Travel 20 miles at  a normal pace, through the countryside on the Villa Road to Nova Jersaeria
--  2nd Francis vision during the rest of the wagon ride: Francis' vision of a hawk in his dream
	- In this vision, you see the hawk flying over the Tiialan countryside with both the Serene Amulet and a small pouch around its neck
	- The hawk flies over many workers toiling in a vineyard, and reaches an estate, the same estate you just came from (the Esposito Estate)
	- The hawk transforms into a young 20-something man with blonde hair, he wears nondescript, black leather armor and he has two daggers hanging from his belt. You notice after exiting his wild shape, the pouch around his neck has grown in size to become a small satchel
		- By all accounts from your mother, this is your father, Marco De Luca...
	- You see him exchange Tiialan greetings with a much younger Albert Dente and quickly enter the Esposito estate, he seems to be in a rush. Albert wears all black and holds a grim look on his face
	- Your vision shifts to the master bedroom of the estate. Lying on the bed is a man about your father's age. He is gravely pale, with bandages covering his entire upper torso. He looks to be unconscious. He matches your mother' descriptions of Nino Esposito. Your father pulls the book he retrieved from the Lineage Archives out of his pouch, and lays it carefully on the bed. He begins trying to wake Nino, casting cure wounds, lesser restoration, even resorting to feeding him a healing potion in desperation. He exhausts all of his magical abilities on Nino, to no avail.
		- It looks like this vision takes place soon after the Midsummer Massacre, when the Fanto Domingos wiped out the Esposito family, and Nino Esposito was the only survivor
			-<end vision>
	 In Nova Jersaeria, ride past The Grand Lineage Archives of Tiialia, it is burnt to the ground
	- Chauncy says it burnt to the ground about 25 years ago
	- It once held all the information about who is descended from who in Tiialia, all the nobles
		-  Even had the bloodlines of the Old Kings of Tiialia, though all the known royal bloodlines died out a century ago during the First Siege of Corrodreth, as we all learned in history class. Surely you remember learning about the Serpent Wars? Read from  [[The War of the Four Families]]
	- Marketplace, Riggle's Runeshop
	In the King's Court:
- Faustia can read the undercommon using spell (show handout)
- Landucci distrusts the party because of the yacht incident in the Forsaken Expanse
	- He has a task for the party that will hopefully get them killed, related to the Vlorn Incursions
	- Sends the party back to the surface hole at his vineyard to "patch it up" but it's actually a trap, with Chauncy and the guards/Tiialan soldiers attacking the party
- Landucci tells Chauncy to go with the party, Landucci says a group of his loyal soldiers will meet the party at his vineyard (the surface hole) on the morrow
- Stay the night in the palace guest rooms
- Skill challenge as wagon begins falling apart on the way back to the surface hole

	- The High Rollers are the only people other than Landucci who know that Nino Esposito has the blood of the old kings of Tiialia
	- Albert Dente may know his location
- Returning to Nova Jersaeria will be difficult
- Outside the city, Sssergio the Yuan-Ti offers to escorts them through the sewers of Tiialia if they pay him 1500 GP and a magic item
	- This allows them to skip the fight at the gate and the fight outside the palace
	- Sssergio mentions he works with Riggle
- Fighting in the streets, 2 skill challenges to avoid Landucci's patrols
		- One potential fight at the city gates (footmen and archers)
			- 3/5 successes = no fight
			- If failed, 3 footmen and 2 archers per failure
			- Sssergio offers his sewer services again for 1600 GP after this fight
-  One potential fight if they don't go through the sewers, in the center of the city where the palace is (honor guards and elite guards)
			- 3/5 successes = no fight
			- If failed, 2 elite guards and 1 honor guard per failure
3rd Francis vision
- In your dream you see your father, Marco De Luca, wearing the Serene Amulet
- With his hands, he makes the druidic sign of the Circle of the Land, and you are once again plunged into misty visions of the past
- This vision picks up right after your last vision ended, with your father in hawk form flying towards the Landucci Vineyard. When he arrives, he transforms into a man and waves at two young boys playfighting with sticks in the yard, they both wave back at him cheerfully. He looks tired.
- Now you see your father sitting in an ornate office, across from a younger Draco Landucci, who is holding the book Marco retrieved from the Lineage Archives. The sound in the vision is muffled, but you hear Landucci say: "This undiscovered lineage... it may upset the balance of power, Marco... and you have told no one else of this?" 
- Your father nods. He has told no one except the unconscious Nino Esposito
- For an instant you see a spasm of emotion on Draco's face, and in the next instant, he brandishes a longsword
- Your father, rightly surprised by this treachery, clutches his amulet and uses it to cast a protection spell on himself, which stops Landucci's blade. He holds his own against landucci with his twin daggers, and to you it seems that he may have won this fight handily had he not expended his spells on Nino... tragic
- Only when a woman, robed and black haired, opens the office door and casts a spell on him does he stop fighting
- Francis, you know how this vision ends, do you look away?
- With your father paralyzed from this woman's spell, you hear Draco Landucci say "I hope you understand, Marco. I truly do. You were a good spymaster… too good., actually”  You see Landucci's blade slide through your father's chest
- He stands over the body, has a short discussion with the black haired wizard woman. "We have to cover this up, the Adonzios and Esposito cannot know of our alliance" She uses a necromancy spell to animate your father's hand, having him pen a short letter, which gets stained with his blood. It's the same letter you found in Nino's office

Session 53:

- Sssssergio offers help for 1500 GP and a magic item
	- He knows a way through the underground river "Dendar's Coil" that connects to the Nova Jersaeria sewer system
	- The entrance to this underground river is beneath a destroyed Yuan-Ti temple to their god Dendar, the Night Serpent
- Nino's part of the plan, while the party navigates the underground river/sewers of Nova Jersaeria with Ssssergio's help:
	- I will take Timander to the city and rescue any fleeing villagers, and prepare for our ploy
	- I will humble myself in front of Landucci and offer him my services as a spymaster in order to search and destroy The High Rollers
	- In 2 days' time I will venture into the sewers from the sluice gate control center in the upper Noble District
	- There, and now I'm just splitballing, I will "capture" you and bring you past the guards, in front of Landucci and The Impotent King...
		- Issues: they will never believe that I was able to capture all 5 of you... we may need to workshop this idea
- Skill challenge to avoid being followed by Vlorn raiders (2 per failure)
	- 3/5 successes needed
- Ssssergio offers his help for a price, or can take risk and do the Star Wars plan which will require deception rolls

		- Above is a murky abyssal sky, and through swim many tentacled aberrations and creatures that defy your human comprehension

	- Memorial building to improve optics for those killed in the crossfire, the public will mostly blame Landucci for these deaths
	- Dwayne, Mike, and Henry memorial government building + a full lifetime pension to each of their families will cost a lot of gold, 2d1000 from each party member to cover the costs. This will be removed from the reward I promised you from the royal coffers
- New Dawn is Red Dawn in Tiialia, customary to distribute gifts to your soldiers
- Covert ops mission to end The Master's threat to Tiialia
	- The Vlorn can be reasoned with, or at the very least their ultimatum doesn't take effect for another 50ish days...
	- The undead are an issue, and they are at our gates lads
	- Hopefully what you find in the royal coffers will assist you on this perilous quest. The whole of the kingdom is counting on you!
