- Nino sent 5 powerful individuals from Nova Jersaeria to treat with The Vlorn, secretly they had plans to banish Proklor the Despoiler from the material plane of Selerim
	- Nino: They failed and were all killed or captured except for Stiago Zabata, a war cleric of Tyr who was gravely injured before he casted Word of Recall, trying to get everyone out, but he wasn't able to reach his fellow party members when he cast the spell, which teleported him back to the Temple of Tyr in Nova Jersaeria
	- Go and talk to Stiago at the Infirmary
		- Proklor resisted all 3 banishment spells cast on him, and the party had to resort to fighting him. They were gravely outmatched in this fight
		-  Bancil Nobeltrim was in this party. Stiago saw him fighting Proklor, even cleaving through two of the beast's four arms with a divine smite that Stiago swears was guided by The Maimed God himself
		- Despite these heroics, the battle quickly turned against Stiago's fellow party members as Proklor set upon them with his foul demonic power. Proklor slew all members of the party except for Bancil, who stood his ground and cried for justice from the heavens. I tried to get him out, but I was swept away by Proklor before I could reach him with my Word of Recall

Session 0 Agenda
- decide on how we will communicate discord w/ notifications on or make a new group chat. 
	- It’s total hell trying to schedule with you if you don’t have notifications on
- The Last Campaign Chapter
	- Episodic sessions that aren't all connected (you can Plane Shift and teleport around now, so travel is mostly trivial)
	- 6-8 episodic sessions, starting with a casino episode
	- Gain a level each session until you hit max level (you’re currently lvl 14, max lvl is 20)
	- At the end of it all, kill or be killed by an evil god
	- If we're missing party members, there may be guest appearances from other people
	- Once we finish this out, we'll figure things out. I'm trying to get other people to try DMing, and I really like the persistent shared world approach to D&D
		- You might have a character who rolls a really cool magic item in one of my sessions, and you can take that character to an adventure run by Bishop, Mike Doom, or some other new DM :) 
- set expectations
	- see guidelines for a fun time in rules
	- you are expected to know your character sheet well enough to play the game without being disruptive to others, and your character is expected to fit into the world (e.g., you can't play George Bush, the statesman from Texas)
	- remember the game is about having fun with your pals and telling cool stories together, it isn't about winning, so don't be a poor sport!
	- be respectful of others and their time, and make an effort to make the game fun for everyone
	- communicate, communicate, communicate!
	- no multiboxing please :)
- Downtime between arcs
	- about 2 months
	- Have everyone answer what their characters have done during downtime
	- Give an example of what Hoary did while the gang was away from Scrimshaw
- Shopping at Arno's and other places
- The Grand Opening of El Presidente Hugh Mann's new casino: The High Roller
