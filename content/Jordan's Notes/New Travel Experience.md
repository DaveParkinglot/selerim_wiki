1. DM decides on the DC for the round(s) or rolls it ([[/r 2d10]] + the highest proficiency bonus in the party)
    
2. Players roll initiative
    
3. The player next in initiative describes the challenge to overcome, and the player who is up rolls against the DC.
    

The player describing the challenge can opt out if they can't think of anything, instead rolling on a table?
This incurs a +1 penalty to the round's DC?
