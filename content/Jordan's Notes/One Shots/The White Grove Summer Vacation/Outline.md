## Situation
Over summer break, Headmaster [[Arctur Execlostrabaum]] has challenged the students of The White Grove to a magical scavenger hunt in the environs around the grove

## Hook
Students who decide to embark on this extra curricular quest will be given extra credits toward their culminating portfolio at the grove, making it essentially a mandatory assignment if you care about your continued success as a spellcaster.


- The scavenger hunt leads the students to several fantastic locations around the grove on campus and off campus
- Students will be split into groups, based on their existing study groups from previous episode
- They will compete against each other in this scavenger hunt 

Order / Scenes
# Session 1
- Figure out if they want to do this in 1 go, or over 2-3 sessions.
- Roll for extracurriculars, level up
- Remedial Intro to Infernal
	- Tony must pass his remedial final exam before school is out for summer
	- If he doesn't pass he has to spend his summer vacation (every short or long rest) submitting assignments (DC 12 checks), and he doesn't get the remedial flame blade cantrip
- Cliffside Conundrum
	- a harpy is across the water on a disconnected island singing its song

# Session 2
- Corrodrethian Temple
	- there is a minor hazard/trap on the bridge over to the temple, and 3 flying snakes fly from the temple to attack
	- after this, Provost Serpentios walks out of the temple claiming he has been fighting off snakes inside. He tries to lure them into the temple for an ambush by telling them that the next item is located inside the temple
	- DC 13 insight to not be surprised DC 18 to understand the ruse
	- yuan-ti broodguard and 6 flying snakes barrel out of the temple door and attack if they don't fall for the ambush

# Session 3, end of scavenger hunt
## TPK development in temple
- Cristos sneaks back to get the clue, and finds Provost Serpentios standing over the unconscious bodies of the party
- He immediately helps them get back on their feet with the Aid spell scroll he had been trying to learn
- We cut over to Bishop, deeper in the temple. Describe these things
	- You wake up, disoriented, chained to a ruined altar
	- 4 chains (on each leg and each arm) attach him to two crumbling Yuan-Ti statues on either side of him 
	- A small hourglass stands 15 feet in front of you at the base of the altar, its sand slowly trickling...
	- You remember:
		- You entered the Corrodrethian temple searching for the next extra-credit scavenger hunt clue, but you overheard a tense voice deeper in the temple
		- Overcome by curiosity, you pressed deeper into the temple complex, stumbling into Provost Serpentios wearing a dreadful black helm
		- He spoke timidly into a green sending stone about his failure to uncover the entrance of "The Fathomless Vault"
		- He ended his message with "Hail Lord Morganth", then you heard a cracking sound
		- He turned two glowing red eyes toward you, and then your muscles tensed up as everything went black...

## Bishop Escape Mechanics
- Silence spell affects the entire altar because of this device (DC 15 Arcana)
- Any attempt to scream or yell is met with ominous silence, not even an echo...
- He has 4 rounds to improve his chance of rescue, with 3 action options (ask what he's going to do, then elaborate on his options)
		- Study action 
			- Arcana (DC 12) why can't you hear anything? https://5e.tools/actions.html#study_xphb
			- History (DC 12) get your bearings, which direction is the exit?
		- Unchain an arm/leg (DC 15 sleight of hand or athletics?)
		- Search action to see the incoming ooze / get a better understanding of surroundings (DC 15 Perception) https://5e.tools/actions.html#search_xphb
			- In the opposite hallway, a shadow moves in the darkness
			- If the repeater is stopped, he can hear a low scraping sound coming from the opposite hallway

## Serpentios Fight
- Serpentios, realizing which way the winds are blowing, begins bargaining for his life and trying to recruit them to Morganth's side 
	- he drops loot and has incriminating evidence
- Cristos,  requests (nicely) at least 3 items from Serpentios' loot, and says he will be nicer to the freshmen on campus and will even give them some of his old notes next semester
		- He wants the amulet of proof of detection/location, both disguise self spell scrolls, and the Uncommon Relic (loot roll)
- Cristos character development + relationship changes?
	- he is sorry for being such a hardass, but he really needs these credits to graduate and he is already a Super Senior
		- "it's just so hard to learn magic and spellcasting when your generations of your family have been dirt farmers!"
		- agrees to a friendly competition to find the 3rd clue and finish the scavenger hunt, but heads back to campus because the temple is giving him the creeps
- hear cries for help coming from deeper in the temple, find Bishop's character chained to an altar with a gelatinous cube approaching (30 ft off screen to start)

## Return to campus 
- long rest + Level up to 3 probably 
- There are a number of individuals receiving scrying tours from various faculty members, and many interviews taking place on campus during the summer to fill out roles
	- The school has been dedicated to the pursuit of Arcane spellcasting while it was under the thumb of Tiialia, now that it has been made an independent institution, things are changing... but the gears of academic bureaucracy move at their own pace
	- Notably, War Hero Captain Crebain Dunland has been brought on as head of security at the school, he also is taking some classes to become better acquainted with spellcasting
- return to campus to tell the Headmaster about Serpentios and his plot. 
- extra curricular / relationship activities
- Study up on the "tree as primal as the wilds themselves" and the best way to get to it either in the library or elsewhere in the school
	- DC 5 check:
		- The primal tree has been withered ever since its primal magicks were used to create an impassable forest between The White Grove and Corrodreth during the Serpent Wars
		- It is west of campus, somewhere...
	- DC 10 check:
		- The primal tree is the great tree to the west of campus
		- Locate a map of the main route student researchers use to reach the tree, which winds through a hot spring marsh teeming with megafauna
	- DC 12 check: (RETCON THIS FOR LAST SESH)
		- The path forks at an abandoned Bullywug settlement
		- Going left leads by the lair of a giant scorpion affectionately named Scorpaxton
		- The right trail is overgrown with razorvine
	- DC 15 check:
		- The forests surrounding the primal tree are known to be home to megafauna, including a pack of giant apes
	- DC 18 check:
		- Razorvine grows rampantly near the primal tree, a razor sharp plant that grows in tangles and hedges, which can tear you to bits if you're not careful

## Primal Marshlands
- warm marsh murky water
- either ooze or the giant scorpion blocks the path in the middle of the marshy trail

## Primal Tree
- Friendly/competitive racing against Cristos Babblestaff, super senior
	- an indifferent giant ape with several slashes on his fur is bathing in the pool
	- There are patches of razorvine all over the branches of the primal tree. Players must succeed on a DC 11 perception check on their turn to avoid touching any razorvine
		- Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and other surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide, 5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC 11; HP 25; and  Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Psychic damage.
		- When a creature comes into contact with razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10 Slashing) damage from the bladelike thorns.
