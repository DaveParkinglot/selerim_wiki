- As an up and coming adventuring party in Scrimshaw City, you have been approached by a mysterious stranger who claims to be the Interim Chief Operating Officer of a well known business in the city. He has a task that, left undone, could spell doom for the local Tiialan eatery “The Spicy Meatball”.
- Last week a group of fey mugged our Senior Accountant Hoary Boulder as he was going on an evening stroll. They stole 18 years from him (which he is actually very happy about), but also they made off with the secret recipe for Arby’s Sauce, the spiciest condiment in all of Scrimshaw
- Hoary had been studying Arby’s Sauce to try to make his own sauce
