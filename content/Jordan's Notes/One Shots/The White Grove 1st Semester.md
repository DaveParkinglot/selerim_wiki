- 3 sessions? Provide 2 choices at the end of each session: e.g., do you want to help free the High Rollers? or do you want to help Hugh Mann get powerful enough so that he himself can defeat Proklor the Despoiler?
- at the white grove
- Hugh Mann, masquerading as master of infernal magicks "Daemon Flamefist" is the teacher
	- Bopus is masquerading as the shrill goblin Tarp and helping him

### The White Grove Background
- The White Grove is encircled by four great trees, which are said to represent the four fundamental pillars of magic—arcane, divine, primal, and infernal. 
- Though the college pre-dates Tiialia, most of Tiialia's artillery mages, who famously laid waste to Corrodreth, were students of The White Grove.
- The Primal Tree has been withered since its magic was channeled to stave off an invasion from Corrodreth, during the Serpent Wars.
- During the Serpent Wars, the Grove was heavily co-opted by The Kingdom of Tiialia, in order to train its artillery mages. Since then it has been jokingly called TACC, or "Tiialan Arcane Cannon College"

### Premise
- In the last year, King Antonino Esposito of Tiialia has put massive funding towards reopening The White Grove as an independent magical institution. 
- For the first time in over two centuries, admission will be granted to anyone with magical abilities—not just those training to become Tiialan artillery mages.
- Arctur Execlostrabaum, the highly eccentric Tiialan archmage, has been chosen as the headmaster of the school. 
	- It goes without saying that his highly progressive mindset has been a topic of discussion amongst conservative Tiialans. He believes magic is a staple of the world, to be shared with all peoples whether north, south, above, or... below...
