- Stand outside the main entrance of The High Roller and be bouncers. This is where the most important guests will be arriving from
- The guests at this entrance arrive in the following order:  
1. Humana is an Indifferent (normal rolls) Night Hag who wants to tease her brother Hugh Mann for his mistake in almost allowing the Abyssal Rift to be open.
	- She can be convinced to spectate invisibly with a minor magic item, a promise, and a DC 10 check
	- She can be convinced to leave the venue entirely with a DC 18 check
2. Baron Neffery and his entourage of devils appears and politely tips the party with a 1 Platinum Piece each. The platinum pieces make a screaming noise if you hold them too long. 
	- He inquires if "that damned demon" Pazuzu has arrived yet, then ducks down and slips onto the ship
3. Billy Bubbler the Fish Devil is an Indifferent (normal rolls) attendee. He rules the waters west of Scrimshaw with his Sahuagin followers. He has very little stake in what is going on, but he tends to take sides without thinking too hard about things, and he has a penchant for chaos. But mostly he's just there for the food.
	- He appears from churning depths of the sea and flops onto the dock. He talks like Tahm Kench and he can be convinced or threatened to leave with a DC 14 check.
	- He can be plied with food or drink, which will lower his DC by 1.
	- If anyone tries to trick him, he will grow unruly and refuse to leave except by force.
4. Pazuzu arrives through a planar portal, which closes in a flurry of abyssal winds. He has an aggressive Australian accent and he doesn't tip the party. Trailing behind him like ducks behind a mother are a few Quasits and Vrock.
5. Hellknight Chauncy appears in a flash of hellish energy and strides over to the bouncers.
	- Hellknight Chauncy is a Hostile attendee and he is seeking to usurp Hugh Mann and place a new El Presidente in power in Scrimshaw City.
	- He cannot be convinced to leave, short of offering him a share of the Scrimshaw City fiend franchise
	- He can, however, be fought. If he is brought to 1/2 health within 2 rounds he may consider leaving the venue with a DC 14 check.
	- Otherwise, he fights to the death, because he will simply re-materialize in the 9 Hells.
