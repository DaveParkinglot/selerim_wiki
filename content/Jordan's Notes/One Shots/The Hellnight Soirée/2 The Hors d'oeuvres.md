 After everyone enters the venue, the airship The High Roller takes to the sky. No one can enter or leave the establishment at this point.
 - Binky is on the piano while his imp familiar Woad Stomeson turns the pages. You can check in with Binky if you have any questions.
 - The scene plays out as Baron Neffery and Pazuzu give each other stink eye from across the room as their entourages posture and eat hors d'oeurvres delivered by the waitstaff (mainly succubi and imps)
 - Many of the attendees are hanging out in the lounge area, avoiding the main hall where Pazuzu and Neffery are
 - Skill Challenge to get an edge in the inevitable showdown later in the night.
	 - Each players picks an enemy type from either Baron Neffery or Pazuzu's entourage and tries to get an edge on them
	 - This could be learning one of their vulnerabilities, learning something personal about them, mogging on them... Idk
	 - Boss guys are DC 15 and the weenies are DC 13
	 - A success means your character gets a +1 to attack and damage rolls against that enemy type
