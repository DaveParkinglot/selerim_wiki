- At some point, later into the evening, things come to a head between Pazuzu and Baron Neffery
- The party has had time to consider the strengths and weaknesses of both, but now they must choose how they handle the melee in the ballroom
- Mechanics:
	- There is a huge melee going on in the ballroom, we focus narrowly on your efforts at whittling down the forces of both sides. 
		- In world, they are attacking each other. 
		- Mechanically, I am not having them attack each other.
	- I roll a d20 for each enemy group's turn. 
		- 11-20, they continue attacking each other. 
		- 1-10, they will attack the party this turn.
		- If at any point, no forces remain on one group's side, the other group attacks the party each turn.

	FIN. Binky delivers the epilogue as The High Roller touches down and the party's stragglers are kicked out, or scraped off the ballroom floor. A fiend feud between Pazuzu and Baron Neffery will surely keep them busy for a time, and their eyes off of our city and our world.
