- The High Roller has been converted into an airship, as it has been given great mechanical wings by Dillon Lonergan, Master Inventor.
Binky explains the mission:
- 3 step plan: 
	- Gatekeep the 3 diaboli non grata
	- Gaslight - lie and pit Pazuzu and Baron Neffery against each other
	- Girlboss - participate in the inevitable fight between Pazuzu and Neffery's forces to dwindle their morale and resources. If you do things right, a feud between the two will overshadow little old Scrimshaw, and no one will try to wrest control of the city from Hugh Mann.
		- Pazuzu and Neffery would never stoop so low as to take matters into their own hands and actually fight each other, it is anathema to do so for such esteemed fiends
- "The first step in preventing a catastrophic re-organization of our fiendfolio is filtering out those who might cause trouble. The fewer discerning eyes at the soiree, the better. But we can't risk turning away anyone too important. We've been on thin-ish ice since Hugh Mann deposed Lord Davos Portnoir, and even thinner ice since we showed weakness during the annual demon invasion... we definitely don't want an interplanar incident on our hands."
	- "Should we look weak in the face of these eminent fiends, then we may risk losing our status as an independent fiend franchise. We do not want the attention of the 9 Hells focused on Scrimshaw."
	- He gives the party a dossier on 3 guests he would specifically like to be filtered out of the party, and 2 that should not be disturbed
		- Filter out:
			- 1. Humana, girlboss sister of Hugh Mann
			- 2. Hellknight Chauncy
			- 3. Billy Bubbler the Fish Devil
		- Let in, and try to pit them against each other. Pick a side if you must, but it would be best if they both suffered catastrophic losses
			- Baron Neffery
			- Pazuzu

Rewards:
- Binky offers reward in the form of loot rolls, which can be rolled but not used during the adventure. If completed, everyone gets the reward they chose.
