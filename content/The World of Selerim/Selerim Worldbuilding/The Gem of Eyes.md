The eye in the gem seems to wander, but never when observed.

- Geblorgurin found the gem in the crater of a fallen star, a dead Marut
- The gem is the "eye" of dead Marut, a nigh invincible creature
	- The eye acts as a power source for the Marut, which are constructs charged with ensuring that contracts are carried out. Most commonly, they are found in Sigil, the City of Doors. https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#marut_mpmm
	- The Maruts serve The Primus, the ruler of Sigil, the City of Doors
	- A Marut being killed is almost unheard of...
- The power contained within the gem is enough to drive most mortals insane.
- [[Master Effree Jypstein]] procured the gem after the Deepmine Dwarves found it in one of [[Geblorgurin the Grand, King of the Dwarves]]'s monuments
- Jypstein decided he was not content with having one object of great power, and so he hired Arcturus the Artificer to devise a ritual by which the gem could be copied
- During the ritual, Jypstein betrayed Arcturus and trapped his soul inside the original gem, making the original copy of the Gem his phylactery
	- He then gave one copied gem to Dr. Drendle hoping that some use could be found for it.
	- He eventually traded the second copy to Lord Draco Landucci of [[The Landucci Family]] in return for a Manual of Flesh Golems that Landucci had procured from the Yuan-Ti necromancers in the ruins of [[Corrodreth, The Salted City]]
	- The original gem he kept for himself, as his phylactery
- [[Clint Weapon]] took it from Drendle after the events at the Aldwood Lighthouse
- The three gems attract each other. Individually, each could be returned or even sold back to The Primus in return for a reward. Marut are as difficult to create as they are to destroy, and the eye of a Marut is certainly a priceless treasure
