- See [[Selerim Timeline]]! The world of Selerim was originally used as a factory of war by [Selvetarm](https://5e.tools/deities.html#selvetarm_drow_mtf), the dark elves' god of war.
	- Despite his dark deeds, Selvetarm remains the namesake of the world.
- The world is analogous to Earth, with similar gravity and rotational patterns.
- There is one (surviving) moon, Lunadel, and one star, Seladel.
- As of 264 B.T., the most widely used calendar is the Tiialan Calendar, which very conveniently has 13 months of 28 days each.
- It should be noted that the diversity seen amongst the peoples of Selerim is such because they were slaves from many worlds, stolen from their homes to work and die for the glory of [The Dark Seldarine](https://5e.tools/tables.html#drow%20deities%20(the%20dark%20seldarine)_mtf) empire.
- The magnificence of [Selvetarm's](https://5e.tools/deities.html#selvetarm_drow_mtf) work meant that he churned through his slave workforce very, *very* quickly. 
	- As such, his mages opened a great many Planar Rifts to gather slaves from other worlds, much as the drow of [[Locations/Vlorngroth]] capture slaves from the surface to this day.
	- Even now, some of these rifts remain dormant, in the hidden places of the world.
	- Travel to other worlds and planes is quite possible if one knows where to look, and how to reactivate the rifts...
- Much of the world was ravaged by the nameless war between [The Seldarine](https://5e.tools/tables.html#elf%20deities%20(the%20seldarine)_mtf) and [The Dark Seldarine](https://5e.tools/tables.html#drow%20deities%20(the%20dark%20seldarine)_mtf), fought 5,000 years before the founding of [[The Kingdom of Tiialia]] (expressed henceforth as B.T.).
	- Ancient elvish magics used in this war still suffuse much of Selerim's lands, corrupting the very ley lines of the world. 
	- This leaves only very select regions of the world habitable by most folk. 
	- There are some who, even to this day, decry the so-called benevolence of The Seldarine's gift. Left to toil and rebuild a ruined world, can such a gift be called freedom?
	- Traveling to these Ruined Regions is often deadly, leaving settlement out of the question. The afflictions of these ancient magics were lost to war and time, making them considerably difficult to dispel, even for the most accomplished spellcasters.
- The flooding from The Darkwells' Eruption between 1,000 and 750 B.T. also had a profound impact on the geography and cultures of Selerim, leaving many regions isolated by what became a new inland sea.
- Sorcerers were anomalously rare until the blood of slain dragons from the Generations' War seeped into the ground, near the present day Forsaken Expanse. 
	- To this day, most sorcerers in the world are born on the eastern side of Tanglewood Peninsula, where the concentration of dragon blood is strongest.
