- Dark pools of unnaturally cold water, said to connect Selerim to the Elemental Plane of Water
- Legends in [[Places/Vlorngroth]] claim that [[Selvetarm]] himself delved through the planes to create the Darkwells.
- The water from the Darkwells is said to have been used to temper the steel of Selvetarm's war machines.
- There are sites with Darkwells throughout the world of Selerim, though many are now underwater. 
- The Darkwells present beneath the [[Frostbore Peaks]] are the last remaining Darkwells that can be easily accessed.
- Long ago, an eruption of the Darkwells flooded much of [[Places/The Inhabitable Lands]], setting the world back, and further reducing its scope.
