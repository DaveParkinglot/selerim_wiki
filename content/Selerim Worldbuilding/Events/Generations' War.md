- War fought thousands of years ago between humans and elves.
- Major causes include human resentment of the elvish gods ([[The Seldarine]]) and the human champion [[Barbanus the Slayer]] hunting and killing the great dragon [[Timphiliax]].
- The ancient battlefields of this war are mostly buried beneath the waves, as it was fought before [[Selerim Worldbuilding/Lore/Darkwells]] erupted.
