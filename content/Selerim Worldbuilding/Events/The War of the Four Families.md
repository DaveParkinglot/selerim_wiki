	- The last king of [[Factions/The Kingdom of Tiialia/Tiialia]], King Seraphino, was killed during the First Siege of [[Places/Corrodreth]]
	- A year after the First Siege, [[Factions/The Kingdom of Tiialia/Tiialia]] rallied for the Second Siege of [[Places/Corrodreth]]. The city was pillaged, destroyed, and finally salted to avenge King Seraphino, the Last King of [[Factions/The Kingdom of Tiialia/Tiialia]]
- Prior to the War of the Four Families, [[Factions/The Kingdom of Tiialia/Tiialia]] had been without a king for 75 years, ruled by a single Regent Lord: Aleemus the Aged. His death opened a power vacuum, which the Four Families began to fight for.
- Originally it was a free for all between the families, but this changed when the Adonzios and the Landuccis formed an alliance after the Midsummer Massacre, when the [[Factions/The Kingdom of Tiialia/The Families of Tiialia/The Fanto-Domingo Family]]  wiped out [[Factions/The Kingdom of Tiialia/The Families of Tiialia/The Esposito Family]]
