## Guests to let in: 
Do NOT bar entry for these two. Even a *mote* of their powers could ruin this world.

### Baron Neffery
- A powerful hell baron who made a name for himself in the Blood War, he is constantly trying to usurp the holdings of other fiends across the multiverse.
- Though he may seem polite, he is always looking for leverage in order to dominate and subjugate others.

### Pazuzu, Dark Angel of the Four Winds
- A storied demon, and the eldest child of the abyss.
- He is one of the only demon lords with good relations with Asmodeus, Lord of Hell.
- Some legends say it was [[NPCs/Other/Pazuzu]] himself who corrupted Asmodeus. Other legends say they are just great drinking buddies.

## Diaboli Non-Grata 
Absolutely do NOT let these jokers into my party!

### Humana
- [[NPCs/Scrimshaw City/Hugh Mann]]'s older sister, by his own account, is probably the reason he became a devil in the first place. She lives to torment mortals, and her younger brother.
- As a night hag, she is more than happy to receive favors and gifts. Try this angle if she simply will not leave.

### Billy Bubbler the Fish Devil
- Billy and his sahuagin followers claim the waters west of Scrimshaw.
- He has very little stake in what happens on the surface, but he tends to take sides without thinking too hard about things... which could be a problem for us.
- Some say he's more a demon than a devil, but regardless he's most likely only coming to whet his insatiable appetite.

### Chauncy the Unrepentant
- This one actually hails from your world of Selerim. Chauncy has betrayed more friends than he's ever had in the name of making a name for himself, and he may be difficult to talk down without a fight.
- He was somewhat recently slain by [[Player Characters/The High Rollers/The High Rollers]] somewhere in the [[Places/Tiialia]], and sent screaming to the fiery battlefields of Avernus.
- It seems that he made his way from Avernus to the Prison Plane of Carceri, where he now works to earn his freedom from a powerful Soul Dealer.
