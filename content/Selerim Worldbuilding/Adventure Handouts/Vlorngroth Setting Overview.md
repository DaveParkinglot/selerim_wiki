## VLORNGROTH
In the cavernous depths of the Underdark, beneath the phosphorescence of the Fungal Firmament, lies the hidden city of [[Places/Vlorngroth]]. [[Places/Vlorngroth]] has long been the seat of power for [[Factions/The Vlorn Dynasty]], an empire long forgotten by most surface dwellers. The recent ascension of High Lord Jorad Kranicz has led to a militaristic renaissance in the city, with further emphasis being placed on infiltrations and incursions into the surface world. Slaves taken from the surface world have been pouring into [[Places/Vlorngroth]] lately, but the High Lord’s ambitions do not end there. Rumor in [[Places/Vlorngroth]] has it that even now, Kranicz plans a full-scale invasion of the surface world from his war room atop Tan’Rin Keep, the towering structure that juts downward from the Fungal Firmament.

## PLANS OF THE HIGH LORD
The true nature of High Lord Kranicz’s plan is known only to his war council, but the [[Places/Vlorngroth]] populace need only look at recent happenings to know that the gears of his plan have begun to turn. Criers recruit able-bodied fighters in every street, and the slaves of the city have been called to combat training for the first time in two centuries. For many [[Places/Vlorngroth]] citizens, the most interesting development is the ongoing "accelerated recruitment program" for the dynasty's most elite group of spies: The Inquisitor's Order. For those looking to make a name for themselves in the ruthless meritocracy of [[Factions/The Vlorn Dynasty]], this is the clearest path forward.

## THE MANOR OF MADNESS
As prophesied by the Matron Mother Aranaea, one resident of Duskveil Asylum will prove necessary to the invasion of the surface world. Both the Council of Matrons and High Lord Kranicz have affirmed this prophecy. In Aranaea’s prophetic vision, the Spider Queen Lolth herself guaranteed that the invasion would fail without the aid of this particular asylum resident. Unfortunately, the nature of prophecy is quite mysterious, and Matron Aranaea has been unable to decipher the identity of this particular resident. As for the asylum, it is known by many as “The Manor of Madness'', and it houses those who have proven themselves detrimental to the city. All residents of the asylum suffer from an affliction—many from surface sickness, some from mishaps with magic, and still others from afflictions far worse than either.

## IN THE SERVICE OF THE HIGH LORD
The Matron Mother Aranaea has provided Spymaster Valnex with the regrettably vague details of her prophetic vision. High Lord Kranicz has placed the utmost priority behind this mission, but he cannot currently spare a Prime Inquisitor, or even a squad of Inquisitors. As such, the Inquisitor Initiates of the accelerated recruitment program have been tapped for this crucial mission. The hopes of the entire Vlorn Dynasty rest in their extremely capable hands.

A [[Selerim Worldbuilding/Adventure Handouts/Inquisitor's Dossier\|dossier]] will be provided with the vague details of Matron Aranaea’s prophetic vision, and the available details of each asylum resident. As Inquisitors, you should not fret over your very likely chance of failure, as there is always another squad of bright-eyed Inquisitor Initiates eagerly awaiting it.
