I will tell you the second task after you have proven yourselves\n\nworthy of our desert:\n\n- infiltrate the sand yacht of the Tiialan Lord Draco Landucci\n\nHe has been taking his lordly friends on sightseeing tours all over\n\nthe forsaken expanse, crushing the bones we harvest to eek out our living\n\nand polluting the oases with the grease spell\n\n-Landucii is on the sands today, and he may not be back for some time. If you are to\n\nsucceed in this task, it must be accomplished today\n\n-I will reward your party with a powerful scroll that I have been saving... saving for quite\n\nsome time\n\n-Revivify Scroll that I did not get to use on an old party member, because Effree revived\n\nthem with foul necromancy first. If only he had let me use the scroll... so much could have been\n\nprevented...\n\nTask 2:\n\n- a pack of gnolls has been gnawing on the bones to devour ancient dragon marrow\n\nUnbelievably, they are led by a desert yeti we have named... \"Big Bad Joe\"\n\n- it's bad enough there have been troll sightings on the outskirts of the desert, but now we have\n\ngnolls and a big yeti?? it's ridiculous!\n\nThe dragon marrow has imbued them with wild magicks, and despite some success, I have\n\nfound it difficult to permanently pacify them. These gnolls seem to multiply every time I see them\n\nPerhaps you will have better luck wiping them out for good..."}
