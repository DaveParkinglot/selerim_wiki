## Adventure Premise
- Bone Tavern is failing, and [[NPCs/Breakwater Cove/Captain Winchester Bone]] needs to remain solvent in his retirement years. Retrieve his hoard of treasure, which is hidden in a quiet cove to the south.

## Outcomes
- The Drakes, as the party began calling themselves, carefully navigated the trap-filled corridors of Bone Cove to find the hidden hoard.
- Captain Winchester Bone now has the cash flow he needs to maintain his exorbitant lifestyle, and Bone Tavern won't go underwater anytime soon!
