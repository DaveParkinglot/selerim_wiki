## Adventure Premise
- You are members of the Tialan army serving in a special cohort called Dunlands Raiders under Captain Crebain Dunland. Your homelands are under attack by the forces of an evil warlock named Morganth.
- The fate of all Tiialia may well rest in your hands. Fight for honor! Fight for glory! Fight for your homelands and send these devils back to the nine hells!

## Outcomes
- Morganth's forces were pushed back into a small hold, where they used a relic called the Blackfyre Orb to summon a devil from the Nine Hells. Dunland's Raiders defeated the devil, and eventually engaged in pitched combat against the remaining forces of Morganth in a barren field, where they were victorious.
- Skeeter Lutz went on a killing spree within the hold, killing many civilians.
- Eclipse Malificent was working for unknown forces, and turned on the party. He stole the Blackfyre Orb, using it to teleport to some abyssal plane.
