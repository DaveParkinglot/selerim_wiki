- Known in these days as "The Salted City", it is rarely talked about by citizens of [[The Kingdom of Tiialia]]
- Now a desolate ruin, occasionally sparking with magical energies

- Destroyed by Tiialia generations ago, the city was ruled by the yuan-ti serpent people
- The Tiialans salted it and the surrounding area after the decade long "Serpent Wars"
