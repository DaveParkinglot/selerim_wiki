- Monty Landucci's backstory:

The life of Montius “Monty” Landucci has been rife with disappointment. As a child, he had hoped to achieve a high station in the Tiialan military to follow in the footsteps of his father, Lord Draco Landucci and his two older brothers, Lorus Lionhelm and Commander Korus. Monty's twin brothers are highly respected throughout Tiialia, and they are both the equal apples of his father's eyes.

Unfortunately, the massive success of his twin boys caused Lord Draco to neglect and ignore his youngest son. At the age of 9, after Monty failed his Youth Red Knights entrance exam for the 3rd time, his father deemed him an unworthy "fail son" and shipped him off to a groundskeeping school in the mountains. This turned out better than expected for Monty’s military aspirations since he befriended Crag Shovelhand, a grizzled dwarvish war veteran turned groundskeeping professor. During Monty’s 10 years of schooling, Crag acted as a mentor to Monty not only in the art of groundskeeping, but also in the art of war.

Now, at age 19, Monty has graduated from groundskeeping school with very high marks. At the behest of his mentor Crag (and against the wishes of his lord father) he has joined up with a Tiialan military unit—the Dunland Raiders. He seeks to claim glory and fame so that he might finally be worthy of the Landucci name.
