- All but wiped out after the Midsummer Massacre, when the Espositos were betrayed and killed en masse by the Fanto-Domingo family
- The only remaining family member is [[Antonino Esposito]], "Nino", who was a friend of [[Francis Greenstrider De Luca|Frankie's]] father
- Quintino Esposito was the progenitor of the family, and he struck a bargain with the Dente family to always serve the Espositos, and in return his family would pay for passage aboard the [[The Necronaut of Mournholde]]
- Nino is actually a distant descendant of the last king of Tiialia, and the last remnant of the royal line that was wiped out 100 years ago
