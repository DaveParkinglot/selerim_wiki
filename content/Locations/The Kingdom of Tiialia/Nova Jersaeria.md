- Capital city of the Kingdom of Tiialia
- This sprawling capital city has grown greatly since it was founded with the help of Geblorgurin, King of the Dwarves some 250 years ago.
- Mob presence in the sewers. The mob boss Rigor Mortoni rules the majority of the sewers though there is also a Yuan-Ti faction in the sewers

- The line of the old Tiialan Kings was thought to have been snuffed out with King Seraphino's death at the First Siege of Corrodreth, during the decades long Serpent Wars. 
- Tiialia was without a true king of royal lineage until Antonino Esposito's true heritage was discovered by Francis "Frankie" Greenstrider of The High Rollers. With this knowledge, the traitor Lord Draco Landucci and his puppet King Adonzio were deposed.
